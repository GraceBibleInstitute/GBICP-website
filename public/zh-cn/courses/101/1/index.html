	<p>In order to understand anything else in the Bible we must first understand sin.  We cannot grasp why there is so much hardship in this world and our life unless we understand sin.  We cannot appreciate our need for a Savior unless we understand sin.  The portions of Scripture used in this Bible study are the ones that deal most directly with this issue.  As we look at these passages, we are going to try to answer the following questions:</p>
<p>• Where did sin originate?</p>
<p>• What exactly is “sin”?</p>
<p>• Who is guilty of sin?</p>
<p>• What does sin do to us?</p>
<p>为了能够理解圣经我们必须首先理解罪。除非我们理解罪，否则我们无法领会为什么这个世界上和我们的生命中会有这么多的苦难。除非我们理解罪，否则我们无法感激我们对救主的需求。这个圣经学习里所用的经文是直接针对这个问题的。当我们学习这些段落时，我们将试着回答下列的问题：</p>
<p>• 罪是从哪里起源的？</p>
<p>• “罪”确切的是什么？</p>
<p>• 谁是有罪的？</p>
<p>• 罪对我们有什么影响？</p>
<p>WHERE DID SIN ORIGINATE?</p>
<p>罪是从哪里起源的？</p>
<p>Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.</p>
<p>请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。</p>
<p>Genesis 1:31 – God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.</p>
<p>创世记1:31－－神看着一切所造的都甚好。</p>
<p>2 Peter 2:4 – God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell.</p>

<p>Genesis 3:4-6 – &ldquo;You will not surely die,&rdquo; the serpent said to the woman.  &ldquo;For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo; When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</p>
<p>创世记3:4-6－－蛇对女人说：“你们不一定会死，因为神知道，你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了，你们便如神能知道善恶。”于是，女人见那棵树的果子好作食物，也悦人眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人有智慧，就摘下果子来吃了；又给她丈夫，她丈夫也吃了。</p>
<p>1 John 3:8 – He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.</p>
<p>约翰一书3:8－－犯罪的是属魔鬼的，因为魔鬼从起初就犯罪。</p>
<p>John 8:44 – [Jesus said,] “You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father&rsquo;s desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”</p>
<p>约翰福音8:44－－【耶稣说，】“你们是出于你们的父魔鬼，你们服的私欲，你们偏要行。他们起初是杀人的，不守真理，因他心里没有真理；他说谎时出于自己，因他本来是说谎的，也是说谎之人的父”</p>
<p>James 1:13 – When tempted, no one should say, &ldquo;God is tempting me.&rdquo; For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.</p>
<p>雅各书1:13－－人被试探，不可说：“我是被神试探”；因为神不能被恶试探，他也不试探人。</p>

<p>This sinful condition was passed on from parents to children throughout the history of the world.</p>
<p>Romans 7:18 – I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.</p>
<p>罗马书7:18－－我也知道在我里头，就是我肉体之中，没有良善。</p>
<p>Romans 8:7 – The sinful mind is hostile to God, it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.</p>
<p>罗马书8:7－－原来体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇；因为不服神的律法，也是不能服。</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:3 – Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.</p>
<p>以弗所书2:3－－本为可怒之子，和别人一样。</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>This sin is a hostile, rebellious, unwilling mindset against God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the italicized portions of those passages, what does this do to me?</p>
<p>根据上述经文中的斜体部分，这个对我有什么影响？</p>
<p>This inherited sinful condition is part of my nature.  It makes me a target for God’s just, punishing anger.</p>
<p>That “sinful nature” that we inherit from our parents impacts our life in a negative way.  Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.</p>
<p>我们从父母那里继承的“有罪的本性”消极地影响我们的生活。请阅读下面经文然后回答相关问题。</p>

<li>
<p>According to those passages, does God judge us on just our actions, or does he also judge the thoughts behind those actions.</p>

<li>
<p>Therefore, how is sin defined?</p>

<p>当我们违背了上帝的__________________，无论是通过犯下有罪的行为还是通过有罪的思想，我们就犯罪了。</p>
<p>We generally speak of two different categories of sin and give them the following definitions. These definitions can serve as the answer to our question, “WHAT IS ‘SIN’?”</p>
<p>我们一般所说的是两种不同的罪，它们的定义如下。这些定义可以作为问题“什么是罪？”的答案。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“ORIGINAL SIN” –  The sinfulness that is handed down from parents to children.  (This is therefore sometimes also referred to as “inherited sin.”)</p>
<p>“原罪”－－ 从父母到孩子传下来的罪。（因此有时这个也指“继承罪”）</p>
<p>“ACTUAL SIN” –  The sins in thought, word, and action that an individual commits on their own.</p>
<p>“本罪”－－ 个体在思想，言语和行为上所犯下的他们自己的罪。</p>
<p>Both types of sin are deserving of God’s punishment.  We’ll look at that in more depth later.</p>
<p>这两种罪都应受到上帝的惩罚。我们将在接下来的学习中更深入地学习。</p>
<p>WHO IS GUILTY OF SIN?</p>
<p>谁是有罪的？</p>
<p>Who is guilty of sin?  If you’re speaking about “original sin,” you obviously have to answer “everyone.”  Original sin is handed down from parents to children at the moment of conception.  So let’s focus in on “actual sin.”  Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.</p>
<p>谁是有罪的？如果你谈到“原罪”，很明显的答案是“每一个人”。原罪是父母从受孕那一刻就传给其孩子的。所以，我们集中学习“本罪”。请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。</p>
<p>Leviticus 19:2 – Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy. (“Holy” can be defined as “perfect” or “righteous” or “without sin.”)</p>
<p>利未记19:2－－你们要圣洁，因为我耶和华你们的神是圣洁的。(“圣洁”可以定义为“完美的”或者“正义的”或者“无罪的”。)</p>
<p>Matthew 5:48 – Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
<p>马太福音5:48－－所以，你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样。</p>
<p>James 2:10 – Whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</p>
<p>雅各书2:10－－因为凡遵守全律法的，只在一条上跌倒，他就是犯了众条。</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>According to those passages, how does God want us to keep his law in our thoughts, in our speech, and in our actions?</p>
<p>根据上述经文，上帝是如何想让我们在思想中，在言语中，以及在行为中遵守他的律法的？</p>
<p>God wants us to keep His law perfectly in our thoughts, speech and actions without ever committing even one sin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about just one slip? Wouldn’t God let that slide?  (Look at James 2:10.)</p>
<p>那么如果只跌倒一次呢？上帝应该不会施加惩罚吧？（参看雅各书2:10）</p>
<p>God expects 100% obedience to His law.  Just one sin makes us a sinner.  He will not ignore even one sin.</p>
<p>On the basis of those passages, what would you guess is the answer to the question, “WHO IS GUILTY OF SIN?”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>基于上述经文，你如何回答“谁是有罪的”这个问题？</p>
<p>All people are guilty of both original sin and actual sin.</p>
<p>Romans 3:23 – All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.</p>
<p>罗马书3:23－－因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。</p>
<p>Psalm 53:3 –  Everyone has turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</p>
<p>诗篇53:3－－他们各人都退后，一同变为污秽；并没有行善的，连一个也没有。</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do these passages support what you wrote in the box above?</p>
<p>上两段经文支持你在上面方框中所写的内容吗？</p>
<p>Yes, they do.</p>
<p>If you wanted to diagram this, you could do it in the following way.  What God demands in his Law is that we live a holy, perfect life… a life that has NO sin. However, what he sees is a life that is tainted by sin, and therefore falls short of the perfection he demands.</p>
<p>如果你想用图解来表示，可以按照下面的方式。上帝的律法要求我们有一个圣洁，完美的生命…一个没有罪的生命。但是，上帝看到的却是一个被罪玷污了的生命，因此亏欠了他完美的要求。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/course-file/101/image/1.png" alt="WHO IS GUILTY OF SIN" title="WHO IS GUILTY OF SIN"></p>
<p>You see how in that diagram one adds up to life and the other to death.  Let’s look at this more closely.</p>
<p>你可以看到在这个图解中一个加起来是生命而另一个则是死亡。让我们更进一步地学习。</p>
<p>WHAT DOES SIN DO TO US?</p>
<p>罪对我们有什么影响？</p>
<p>Genesis 2:16-17 – And the LORD God commanded the man, &ldquo;You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>创世记2:16-17－－耶和华  神吩咐他说：“园中各样树上的果子，你可以随意吃，只是分别善恶树上的果子，你不可吃，因为你吃的日子必定死！”</p>
<p>Ezekiel 18:4 – The soul who sins is the one who will die.</p>
<p>以西结书18:4－－犯罪的，他必死亡。</p>
<p>Romans 6:23 – The wages of sin is death.</p>
<p>罗马书6:23－－罪的工价乃是死。</p>
<p>Romans 5:12 – …sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men…</p>
<p>罗马书5:12－－…这就如罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的；于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>According to those passages, what is one consequence of sin?</p>
<p>根据上述经文，罪的一个结果是什么？</p>
<p>Sin brings death, separation from God and His blessings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you understand that “death came to all men” as the result of Adam and Eve’s sin in the Garden of Eden?  (Hint – Think about what we said concerning original sin.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>如何理解“死就临到众人”是亚当和夏娃在伊甸园犯罪的结果？（提示――回想我们所提到的原罪。）</p>
<p>Death is the consequence of  sin.   Our inherited condition of original sin has us starting life in a position of being dead to God (separated from Him).</p>
<p>Isaiah 59:2 – But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.</p>
<p>以赛亚书59:2－－但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝；你们的罪恶使他掩面不听你们。</p>
<p>2 Peter 2:4 – God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in the gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment.</p>
<p>彼得后书2:4－－就是天使犯了罪，神也没有宽容，曾把他们丢在地狱，交在黑暗坑中，等候审判。</p>
<p>Matthew 10:28 – …be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</p>
<p>马太福音10:28－－…惟有能把身体和灵魂都灭在地狱里的，正要怕他。</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the ultimate consequence of sin?</p>
<p>罪的最终结果是什么？</p>
<p>The ultimate consequence of sin is eternal separation from God  and eternal torments in hell.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:1 – As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins.</p>
<p>以弗所书2:1－－你们死在过犯罪恶之中。</p>

<p>What power do we have to take care of sin on our own?  (Hint – Think of how much power a corpse has to take care of itself.)</p>
<p>我们有什么样的力量来处理我们自己的罪？（提示――想象一下尸体有多大力量来处理他自己。）</p>
<p>We have no power to overcome of problem of sin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>基于以上经文，如何回答问题“我的罪对我有什么影响？”</p>
<p>Sin ruins me.  It brings me death and separation from God.</p>
<p>Every single person is lost in their sin.  But does that mean that we will experience the punishment of hell?  That’s the main focus of the second key concept – GRACE.</p>
<p>每一个人都在他的罪里迷失。但是这意味着我们将在地狱里亲身接受惩罚吗？那便是第二个关键概念的主要关注点――恩典。</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:4-5 –  But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions – IT IS BY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED.</p>
<p>以弗所书2:4-5－－然而，神既有丰富的怜悯，因他爱我们的大爱，当我们死在过犯中的时候，便叫我们与基督一同活过来――你们得救是本乎恩。</p>
<p>TAKING IT DEEPER…</p>
<p>深入思考…</p>
<p>A. Agree or Disagree – God is not angry if we sin accidentally.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－如果我们意外地犯罪，上帝不会生气。

Disagree.  Sin is still sin.
</code></pre>
<p>B. Agree or Disagree – Although children learn bad habits from others, basically they are good and want to do right.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－尽管孩子们从别人哪里学到了不好的习惯，但是基本上他们是良善的而且想做好。

Disagree.   Children are born with original sin and sin on their own initiative.
</code></pre>
<p>C. Agree or Disagree – God must not hold infants and young children accountable for their sins, because they are too young to know what they are doing.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－上帝必不会要求婴儿和小孩子对他们的罪负责，因为他们太小了不知道他们在做什么。

Disagree.   God does not make exceptions to His law demands.  Ignorance is not innocence.
</code></pre>
<p>D. Agree or Disagree - Some people are able to live a life that conforms perfectly to God’s Law.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－有些人活着能完美地遵守上帝的律法。

Disagree.   All are sinful and all commit sins.  Some people are outwardly better morally than others, but all sin.
</code></pre>
<p>E. Agree or Disagree – The Bible tells us that God is loving.  Therefore God wouldn’t actually send anyone to hell.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－圣经告诉我们上帝是慈爱的。因此上帝事实上不会让任何人下地狱。

Disagree.   God is loving and wants to help and deliver people from sin.  However, God is also just and must punish sin.
</code></pre>
<p>F. Agree or Disagree – Sinful actions (such as killing someone or stealing) are worse than sinful speech (such as lying or cursing).  And sinful speech is worse than sinful thoughts (such as lust or hatred).</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－有罪的行为（比如杀人或者偷窃）比有罪的言语（比如说谎或者诅咒）要坏。有罪的言语比有罪的思想（比如性欲或者憎恨）要坏。

Agree.  In human thinking some sins are more damaging than others and should be punished accordingly.  Disagree.  Sin is sin.  Every sin is an offense against the infinite love and justice of God and deserving of death.
</code></pre>
<p>G. Agree or Disagree – No one has ever lived their entire life without committing a sin.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－没有人活了一辈子没有犯罪的。

Disagree.   Jesus Christ has.   We might also say that a baby that dies before birth has not committed an actual sin, but that baby still has original, inherited sin with its hostile, rebellious attitude toward God and His law.
</code></pre>
<p>H. What do you think?  If people are basically good, is it fair that God still punishes them for the very few sins that they do commit?</p>
<pre><code>你怎么认为？如果人基本上是良善的，上帝仍然惩罚他们所犯下很少的罪，这是公平的吗？

Yes, it is fair for God to punish a person for their sins.  He will punish people justly in accordance with their guilt.
</code></pre>
