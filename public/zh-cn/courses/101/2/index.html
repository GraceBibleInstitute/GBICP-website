	<p>In the last lesson, we looked at the utter hopelessness of mankind and the inability of anyone to save themselves from the guilt of their sin.  In this lesson, we’re going to look at God’s response to that hopelessness – grace.  Here are the questions we hope to answer in this lesson:</p>

<p>• What was God’s gracious plan of salvation?</p>
<p>• What is the result of God showing his grace to us?</p>

<p>• 上帝恩慈的拯救计划是什么？</p>

<p>1 John 4:9-10 – This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.</p>

<p>Galatians 4:4-5 – But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.</p>
<p>加拉太书 4:4-5－－及至时候满足，神就差遣他的儿子，为女子所生，且生在律法以下，要把律法以下的人赎出来，叫我们得着儿子的名分。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the italicized portions of those passages, what did God do, in his love, to save us from our sins?</p>
<p>根据上述经文斜体部分，上帝在他的爱中做了什么来把我们从罪中拯救出来？</p>
<p>In His love, God sent His Son into the world to save us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the underlined portions of those passages, what was God’s Son going to be for us, in order that we might be saved from our sins?</p>
<p>根据上述经文划线部分，为了把我们从罪中拯救出来，上帝的儿子将成为我们的什么？</p>
<p>God’s Son was going to be the sacrifice offered for us so that we might be saved.</p>
<p>God’s grace – the undeserved love he has for humankind – is seen most clearly when we look at the way he sent his Son to pay for sins.  Let’s look more closely at God’s Son, Jesus, and at how Jesus paid for our sins.  Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.</p>
<p>上帝的恩典――他给人类的不应得的爱――当我们看到他是如何派他儿子去赎我们的罪时是最清楚的。让我们更进一步地去看上帝的儿子，耶稣，以及耶稣是如何替我们赎罪的。请阅读下列经文然后回答相关问题。</p>
<p>Hebrews 4:15 – For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are – yet was without sin.  (The “high priest” here is a reference to Jesus.)</p>

<p>彼得前书2:22－－ “他（基督）并没有犯罪，口里也没有诡诈。”</p>

<p>以赛亚书7:14－－因此，主自己要给你们一个兆头，必有童女怀孕生子，给他起名叫以马内利（就是“神与我们同在”的意思）。</p>
<p>1 John 5:5 –  Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.</p>
<p>约翰一书5:5－－胜过世界的是谁呢？不是那信耶稣是神儿子的吗？</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>According to the italicized portions of those verses, what was special about Jesus’ life?</p>
<p>根据上述经文斜体部分，耶稣的生命有什么特别之处？</p>
<p>Jesus lived a perfect life in which He never committed a sin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is that possible?  How was Jesus able to go his entire life without committing even one sin?  (Look at the underlined portions of those passages.)</p>
<p>那怎么可能？耶稣如何能够活了一辈子却没有犯过一次罪呢？(参看上述经文划线部分。)</p>
<p>Jesus was able to live His entire life without sinning because He was the holy God.</p>
<p>When Jesus died on the cross then, something remarkable happened.  God performed an exchange.   Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.</p>
<p>所以当耶稣死在十字架上的时候，不平常的事发生了。上帝做了一个交换。请阅读下列经文然后回答相关问题。</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:21 – God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>哥林多后书5:21－－神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。</p>
<p>Isaiah 53:5-6 – But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.    We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p>
<p>以赛亚书53:5-6－－哪知他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤。因他受的刑罚，我们得平安；因他受的鞭伤，我们得医治。 我们都如羊走迷；各人偏行己路；耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在他身上。</p>
<p>1 Peter 3:18 – For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God.</p>
<p>彼得前书3:18－－因基督也曾一次为罪受苦，就是义的代替不义的，为要引我们到神面前。</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:7 – In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>以弗所书1:7－－我们藉这爱子的血得蒙救赎，过犯得以赦免，乃是照他丰富的恩典。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We said that on the cross, God performed an exchange.  He took something away from us and gave it to Christ.  What is it he took away from us?  (Look at the italicized portions of those passages.)</p>
<p>我们说在十字架上上帝做了一个交换。他把某物从我们身上拿走，并且把它给了基督。他把什么东西从我们身上拿走了？（参照上述经文中斜体部分。）</p>
<p>God took all our sins from us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second half of this exchange, God took something from Christ and gave it to humankind.  What?  (Look at the underlined portions of those passages.)</p>
<p>在这个交换的第二部分，上帝吧某物从基督身上拿走，并把它给了我们。是什么？（参看上述经文划线部分。）</p>
<p>God gave us the righteousness or holiness of Jesus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why was God willing to do this?  (Look at the end of Ephesians 1:7.)</p>
<p>为什么上帝愿意做这样的事呢？（参看以弗所书1:7最后部分。）</p>
<p>God was willing to do this because of His grace, His love for sinners who have given up every right to be loved.</p>
<p>Remember in the last lesson we diagrammed what God demands in our lives and what he sees in our lives.  It looked like this.</p>
<p>上节课我们用如下图解说明了上帝要求我们生命中的什么以及上帝看到我们生命中的什么。</p>
<p><img src="/course-file/101/image/1.png" alt="WHO IS GUILTY OF SIN" title="WHO IS GUILTY OF SIN"></p>
<p>But now we’ve seen that Christ’s life met those demands of God’s Law.  He never sinned in thought, speech, or action.  In this gracious exchange, God gives us credit for Christ’s holy life.  And he gives Christ credit for our sinful life.  Therefore, on the cross, we see Christ getting punished for our sins.  You could diagram this gracious exchange like this.</p>
<p>但是现在我们看到基督的生命满足了上帝律法的要求。他从未在思想上，言语上或者行为上犯罪。在这个恩慈的交换里，上帝吧基督圣洁生命的记录给了我们，把我们有罪生命的记录给了基督。因此，在十字架上，我们看到基督因我们的罪受到惩罚。你可以如下图解这个恩慈的交换。</p>
<p><img src="/course-file/101/image/2.png" alt="WHAT WAS GOD’S GRACIOUS PLAN OF SALVATION" title="WHAT WAS GOD’S GRACIOUS PLAN OF SALVATION"></p>
<p>We should look at one more thing about God’s gracious plan of salvation.  We need to know why it is we can be certain that Jesus paid for ALL sin.  Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.</p>
<p>我们应该看到另一件关于上帝恩慈的拯救计划的事。我们需要知道为什么我们能够肯定耶稣偿还了所有的罪。请阅读下列经文然后回答相关问题。</p>
<p>Romans 6:23 – The wages of sin is death.</p>
<p>罗马书6:23－－因为罪的工价乃是死。</p>
<p>Matthew 28:5-6 – The angel said to the women, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.  He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.</p>
<p>马太福音28:5-6－－天使对妇女说：“不要害怕！我知道你们是寻找那钉十字架的耶稣。他不在这里，照他所说的，已经复活了。</p>
<p>Luke 24:37-39 – (After Jesus’ death and resurrection) – [The disciples] were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.  [Jesus] said to them, &ldquo;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?  Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>路加福音24:37-39－－（在耶稣死亡和复活之后）－【门徒】却惊慌害怕，以为所看见的是魂。耶稣说：“你们为什么愁烦？为什么心里起疑念呢？你们看我的手，我的脚，就知道实在是我了。摸我看看！魂无骨无肉，你们看，我是有的。”</p>
<p>Romans 4:25 – He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.</p>
<p>罗马书4:25－－耶稣被交给人，是为我们的过犯；复活，是为叫我们称义。</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:17 – If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</p>
<p>哥林多前书15:17－－基督若没有复活，你们的信便是徒然，你们仍在罪里。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think back to the previous lesson.  What did we say was one of the major consequences of sin? (Look at Romans 6:23 above.)</p>
<p>回想上节课，我们说罪的主要结果之一是什么？（参看上面罗马书6:23。）</p>
<p>One of the major consequences of sin is death, separation from God, His love and His blessings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What then proves that Jesus defeated sin?  (Look at the italicized portions of those verses.)</p>
<p>什么证明了耶稣战胜了罪？（参看上述经文斜体部分。）</p>
<p>Jesus’ resurrection from death proves that Jesus defeated sin for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 15:17, is this an important doctrine of the Bible?</p>
<p>根据哥林多前书15:17，这是圣经中的一条重要的教义吗？</p>
<p>Yes, the resurrection of Jesus is a vital teaching.  If Jesus had not been raised from the dead, then we would not know that He has fully paid for our sin.   We would have no Savior.</p>
<p>On the basis of all the passages we have looked at in this section of our Bible study, how would you answer that question, “WHAT WAS GOD’S GRACIOUS PLAN OF SALVATION?”  (Please include the exchange that was made on the cross and the proof that our sins are completely paid for.)</p>
<p>基于上述我们所学经文，如何回答问题“什么是上帝恩慈的拯救计划？”（请包括在十字架上所完成的交换以及我们的罪已经完全被偿还的证明。）</p>
<p>God’s gracious plan of salvation was to have His Son, Jesus, enter the world and become the substitute for all sinners.  Jesus lived a holy, perfect life for us, died as the acceptable sacrifice to God for our sins and rose from the dead to assure us that He had won forgiveness and eternal life for us.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE RESULT OF GOD SHOWING HIS GRACE TO US?</p>
<p>上帝向我们显明他的恩典的结果是什么？</p>
<p>Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.</p>
<p>请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。</p>
<p>Romans 8:1 – Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>罗马书8:1－－如今，那些在基督耶稣里的就不定罪了。</p>
<p>2 Timothy 1:9-10 – This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</p>
<p>提摩太后书1:9-10－－这恩典是万古之先，在基督耶稣里赐给我们的，但如今藉着我们救主基督耶稣的显现才表明出来了。他已经把死废去，藉着福音，将不能坏的生命彰显出来。</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:14-15 – Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death &ndash; that is, the devil &ndash;  and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.</p>
<p>希伯来书 2:14-15－－儿女既同有血肉之体，他也照样亲自成了血肉之体，特要藉着死败坏那掌死权的，就是魔鬼， 并要释放那些一生因怕死而为奴仆的人。</p>
<p>Titus 3:5-7 – [God] saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p>提多书3:5-7－－【上帝】便救了我们，并不是因我们自己所行的义，乃是照他的怜悯，藉着重生的洗和圣灵的更新。圣灵就是神藉着耶稣基督我们救主厚厚浇灌在我们身上的，好叫我们因他的恩得称为义，可以凭着永生的盼望成为后嗣。</p>
<p>Romans 5:17 – For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God&rsquo;s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>罗马书5:17－－若因一人的过犯，死就因这一人作了王，何况那些受洪恩又蒙所赐之义的，岂不更要因耶稣基督一人在生命中作王吗？</p>
<p>Romans 11:6 – And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.</p>
<p>罗马书11:6－－既是出于恩典，就不在乎行为；不然，恩典就不是恩典了。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the italicized portions of those verses, can you name three things we no longer need to fear?</p>
<p>根据上述经文斜体部分，你能否命名我们不需要再害怕的三件事？</p>
<p>Because Jesus has won our salvation, we no longer need to fear 1) being condemned by God for our sins, 2) the devil having power over us, and 3) eternal death in hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through God’s grace, what do we get to look forward to?  (Look at the underlined portions of those passages.)</p>
<p>根据上帝的恩典，我们期盼得到什么？（参看上述经文划线部分。）</p>
<p>Through God’s grace, we look forward to eternal life with God in heaven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do our good works play any part in our salvation?  (Look at Romans 11:6.)</p>
<p>我们的好行为在我们的拯救中起任何作用吗？（参看罗马书11:6。）</p>
<p>Our good works have no role in our salvation.  Salvation is entirely a gift of God to us because of what Jesus did to save us.</p>
<p>On the basis of these passages, how would you answer that question, “WHAT IS THE RESULT OF GOD SHOWING HIS GRACE TO US?”</p>
<p>根据上述经文，如何回答问题“上帝向我们显明他的恩典的结果是什么？”</p>
<p>The result of God showing His grace to us is that we have been saved from our great enemies of sin, Satan and death and that we now have forgiveness, acceptance by God and eternal life.</p>
<p>God’s grace is that undeserved love he showed to all humankind.  It moved him to send his Son Jesus to pay for all the sins of all people.  But, unfortunately, not all people receive the benefits of Christ’s death and resurrection.  Why do some receive eternal life and not others?  That is the focus of our next key concept – FAITH.</p>
<p>上帝的恩典是他向人类所显明的不应得的爱。这让他把他儿子耶稣派来赎所有人的罪。但是，可惜地是，不是所有的人都接受了耶稣死亡和复活的恩惠。为什么有些人接受了永生但是其他人没有呢？那就是下一个关键概念的聚焦－－信心。</p>

<p>TAKING IT DEEPER…</p>
<p>深入思考&hellip;</p>
<p>A. Agree or Disagree – God loves all good people.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－上帝爱所有的好人。

Agree.  God loves everyone.  He has provided a Savior who paid for the sins of all people and has won eternal life for all people.
</code></pre>
<p>B. Agree or Disagree – Some people are more deserving of God’s grace than others.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－有些人比其他人更应受到上帝的恩典。

Disagree.   We all sin and possess nothing deserving of God’s love and favor to give Him.
</code></pre>
<p>C. Agree or Disagree – Jesus loved us by living a sinless life.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－通过没有罪的生活，耶稣爱我们。

Agree.  Jesus’ keeping of God’s commands was done for us as part of what He had to do to save us.  We owe God a perfect life.   Jesus had fulfilled that obligation as our Substitute.
</code></pre>
<p>D. Agree or Disagree – Jesus’ main job was to show us how to live a God-pleasing life.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－耶稣的主要工作是教我们如何过上帝喜悦的生活。

Disagree.   Jesus is a wonderful example for us on how to live.  But His main job was to be our Savior and deliver us from sin and death.
</code></pre>
<p>E. Agree or Disagree – Jesus could have saved himself by coming down from the cross.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－耶稣可以从十字架上走下来以拯救自己。

Disagree.   Jesus offered and decided to become our Savior from eternity.  Once He made that commitment there was no turning back from it.   It He had come down from the cross, He would have broken His commitment and failed in His mission.
</code></pre>
<p>F. Agree or Disagree – The virgin birth proves Jesus was the Son of God.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－生于童贞女证明了耶稣是上帝的儿子。

Agree.  The Virgin Birth along with the conception of Jesus in Mary by the Holy Spirit

Is the miracle that allowed the eternal Son of God to also become a true human being

while still being the Son of God.
</code></pre>
<p>G. Agree or Disagree – Our Savior had to be both true man and true God.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－我们的救主必须既是真人也是真神。

Agree.   Jesus had to be a true man to take our obligation under God’s law and to obey and suffer and die in our place.  He also had to be true God so that He could multiply His obedience and sacrifice to cover the obligations of all people.
</code></pre>
<p>H. Agree or Disagree – God shows love and offers forgiveness to those in whom he sees some merit.</p>
<pre><code>同意与否－－上帝向他看到有优点的人显明爱并施以原谅。

Disagree.   God’s love and forgiveness are free gifts of His grace in Jesus.
</code></pre>
<p>I. What do you think?  When Jesus was on the cross, did he deserve to die?</p>
<pre><code>你如何认为？当耶稣在十字架上的时候，他应该受死吗？

Yes and No.   Jesus personally had no sins for which He deserved any punishment.  However, Jesus was serving as our Substitute and was bearing our sins and our curse and punishment for those sins.  In that sense, Jesus “deserved” to die.
</code></pre>
<p>J. What do you think?  If Jesus paid for all sins, do I have free license to go out and commit whatever sins I want?</p>
<pre><code>你如何认为？如何耶稣赎了所有的罪，那么我有免费执照可以去犯我所想的罪吗？

No, we do not have a license to sin.  God has not abolished His law.  We are still obligated to live a life of perfect love toward God and all people.  Because of the salvation Jesus has given us, this is what we want to do to show our thanks and love for God.
</code></pre>
<p>K. What do you think?  Wouldn’t Jesus’ death only pay for the sins that had been committed before his death?  Are all the sins that were committed AFTER Jesus’ death still paid for? What about the sins I will likely commit tomorrow, and the next day, and 25 years from now?</p>
<pre><code>你如何认为？耶稣的死不是仅仅赎了那些在他死之前的罪吗？在耶稣死之后的罪也被赎了吗？那么我明天可能将犯下的罪呢？后天呢？25年以后呢？

In the Bible, God says that Jesus paid for all the sins of all people of all time.  That covers all our present and future sins.  When God transferred the sins of people to Jesus, it is just as easy for Him to gather up all future sins as well as all past sins and

put them on Jesus’ soul.
</code></pre>
<p>L. What do you think?  The Bible calls our salvation by grace “a gift.”  Imagine you were given a birthday present, but then the person who gave it to you told you that if you wanted to keep it, you had to wash their car.  Would that really be a gift?</p>
<pre><code>你如何认为？圣经称我们通过恩典的拯救为“礼物”。想象一下你得到了一个生日礼物，但是给你礼物那人又告诉你如果你想要拥有这个礼物，你必须洗他的车。那是一个真的礼物吗？

No, having to wash a car as a condition for getting the car makes the car no longer a gift.   However, God’s gift of salvation is so wonderful that it moves us to want to do good things to serve, honor and thank God.
