<p><strong>Jesus heals a woman and raises Jairus’ daughter &ndash; Luke 8:41-56</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣医治了一个妇人并使睚鲁的女儿复活 &ndash; 路加福音8：41-56</strong></p>
<p>After healing the men from Gadara, Jesus and his followers returned across the Sea. There he was met by a happy crowd. One man in particular was not only glad but needed to see Jesus. Jairus, the head of a local synagogue, begged Jesus to come and save his dying 12-year old daughter.</p>
<p>治好从加大拉来的人之后，耶稣和门徒回来打算渡到海的对面去。在那边欢呼的人群迎接耶稣。有一个特别的人不仅仅是很高兴，而是有需要见耶稣。睚鲁，当地管理会堂的人，祈求耶稣来救他快要死的12岁的女儿。</p>
<p>While Jesus was going with Jairus a woman with a severe bleeding problem made her way through the crowd and touched his clothes. According to Old Testament Law (15:25-27) she was unclean and was not permitted to touch anyone. But she too was desperate. Jesus showed that he knew all things by recognizing her need.  He then showed he was all powerful by healing her. But Jesus would soon show that he had even greater power!</p>
<p>在耶稣和睚鲁同去的时候，一位患有严重血漏的妇人从人群中挤过来，摸耶稣的衣服。根据旧约的律法（15:25-27），她不洁净而且不允许碰触别人。但她也是那么的急切。耶稣通过知晓她的需求来向众人显明他无所不知。然后耶稣又通过治愈患血漏的妇人彰显自己的全能。耶稣很快要显明他又更大的能力！</p>
<p>By this time Jairus’ daughter had died. When Jesus reached his house a crowd of crying people had already gathered.  Jesus cleared the room where the dead girl lay, keeping only Peter, James, and John with him.  He then restored the girl to life.</p>
<p>这时睚鲁的女儿已经死了。当耶稣到达睚鲁家时，一大群哀哭的人已经聚集起来。耶稣让人们离开那死了的女儿躺卧的房间，只留下彼得、雅各和约翰同他一起。然后他使女儿复活了。</p>
<p>By raising this girl, and by raising a widow’s son in the town of Nain (Luke 7:11-17), Jesus shows us not only his love for suffering people but his total power and authority as well. When the Prince of Life speaks, even the dead listen and obey. Therefore, death loses its sting for the Christian (1 Corinthians 15:55-56). When we remember Jairus’ daughter and the widow’s son, several New Testament verses take on special meaning for us. For example, St. Paul, speaking about Judgment Day, says “the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command . . . and the dead in Christ will rise first . . . And so we will be with the Lord forever” (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17). Interestingly, 1 Thessalonians 4:18 concludes, “Therefore encourage each other with these words.”</p>
<p>使睚鲁的女儿复活，还有在拿因城使寡妇的儿子复活（路7:11-17），耶稣借由这两个人的复活不仅向我们彰显他对受苦的人的爱，还显明了他的全能和权柄。当生命的王说话的时候，甚至是死的人也要听从和遵行。因此，对于基督徒来说死失去了它的毒钩（林前15:55-56）。当我们想起睚鲁的女儿和寡妇的儿子的时候，几节新约经文对于我们来说就有特别的意思了。举个例子来说，圣徒保罗讲到审判之日时，这样说：“主必亲自从天降临，有呼叫的声音……那在基督里死了的人必先复活……这样，我们就要与主永远同在”（帖前4:16-17）。有趣的是，提前4:18结尾这样说：“所以你们当用这些话彼此劝慰。”</p>
<p><strong>Jesus heals the blind and the mute &ndash; Matthew 9:27-34</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣医治了瞎子和哑巴 &ndash; 马太福音9：27-34</strong></p>
<p>As Jesus was leaving Jairus’ home, he was asked to help other needy people. He healed two blind men so they could see again.  He threw a demon out of a man so that he could speak again.  The people were amazed.  However, the Pharisees responded as usual: “It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons” (Matthew 9:34).</p>
<p>当耶稣离开睚鲁家时，被请求去帮助别的有需要的人。他治好了两个瞎子，他们就能再次看见了。他赶走了污鬼，那人就能说话了。人们都惊奇耶稣所做的。然而法利赛人的反应和往常一样：“他是靠着鬼王赶鬼”（太9:34）。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus responds to the charge that he works with Satan &ndash; Luke 11:14-26</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣回应说祂与魔鬼同工的指责 &ndash; 路加福音11：14-26</strong></p>
<p>It was late summer or early fall of A.D. 28 when Jesus and his disciples finally set out for home. Possibly about noon they arrived in Capernaum hungry and tired from a long walk. No sooner had they sat down to eat than a great crowd gathered to hear Jesus. As he did so often, Jesus forgot about his own needs and thought of other people first.  He began to preach words of spiritual rest and to fill the listeners with the gospel. But his friends did not understand this total concern for the ministry.  They thought it showed that he was insane (Mark 3:21).</p>
<p>耶稣和门徒最终动身回家是在供货源28年的夏末或初秋时节。他们大约在中午到达迦百农，经过长途跋涉，他们又累又饿。他们刚坐下来要吃饭，就有一大群人聚集起来要听耶稣讲道。和往常一样，耶稣忘记自己的劳累与饥饿，而首先考虑别人的需求。他开始讲有关灵的休息的话题，并用福音充满那些听众们。但是，他对传道的全然关注，他的朋友们并不理解。他们认为耶稣有点癫狂了（可3:21）。</p>
<p>That afternoon Jesus healed a man who could not hear or speak by throwing a demon out of him. When the crowd saw this, they began to compare Jesus to the promised Messiah. But the Pharisees, in order to protect their own power, accused Jesus of being controlled by Satan (Beelzebub).  They said that he was doing his miracles through the devil’s power.</p>
<p>那天下午耶稣治好了一个不能听或者不能说的人，将他里面的污鬼赶出。当会众看到这些时，就开始把耶稣与将来的弥赛亚相比。但是法利赛人为了保护他们自己的权势，就指责耶稣被撒旦（别西卜）所掌控。他们说耶稣靠着魔鬼的能力行出这些神迹。</p>
<p>Jesus defended himself with common sense. “Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub. Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out” (Luke 11:17-19)?</p>
<p>耶稣用常识为自己辩护。“凡一国自相纷争，就成为荒场；凡一家自相纷争，就必败落。若撒旦自相纷争，他的国怎能站得住呢？因为你们说我是靠着别西卜赶鬼。我若靠着别西卜赶鬼，你们的子弟赶鬼又靠谁呢”（路11:17-19）？</p>
<p>Christ went on to speak about a type of sin that could not be forgiven-a sin against the Holy Spirit. Although this sin is often not understood or used properly, it is really not so puzzling.</p>
<p>基督继续讲，敌对圣灵的罪时不能被赦免的。尽管这种罪经常不被理解或者正确使用，但是确实不那么令人费解。</p>
<p>The work of the Holy Spirit is to lead people to repent of their sins and believe in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 7:10; 1 Corinthians 12:3). But sometimes a person who has come to faith later decides to speak or act against the Holy Spirit.  He rejects all attempts made by the Spirit to influence him and recall him to faith. If this happens and he no longer listens to the Spirit, how can he repent and come to faith again? (Also compare Luke 12:10; 1 John 5:16; Hebrews 6:4-8).</p>
<p>圣灵做工引到人们认罪悔改，并相信耶稣基督（林后7:10；林前12:3）。但有时已经信的人后来决心在言语或行为上干犯圣灵。他拒绝所有圣灵所发出的信号，那些影响他、让他回转信主的声音。如果这些发生在他身上，他就再也不听从圣灵，那么他怎么能认罪悔改、再次相信呢？（此处亦可对照路加福音12:10；约翰一书5:16；来6:4-8）。</p>
<p><strong>Jewish leaders demand a sign from Jesus &ndash; Matthew 12:38-45</strong></p>
<p><strong>犹太人的领袖要求耶稣行神迹 &ndash; 马太福音12：38-45</strong></p>
<p>Jesus’ logical words and his stern warning did not bring the Pharisees to repent. Now they demanded that Jesus show them some miracle or sign to prove he was God’s Son. They forgot all about Jesus’ earlier miracles. So Jesus refused to give another sign at that time.  Instead, he hinted that soon the greatest of all signs would take place. Just as in the Old Testament Jonah (1:17) was in the fish for three nights and days and then was thrown up on the shore alive, so Christ would die and three days later be seen alive.</p>
<p>耶稣符合逻辑的话语和严厉的警告没能让法利赛人悔改。现在他们要求耶稣像他们显示神迹或者记号，以证明他是上帝的儿子。他们全然忘记了耶稣之前所行得神迹。所以那时耶稣拒绝了他们。耶稣反而是暗示他们，所有记号中最大的一个很快就会发生了。正如旧约中约拿（1:17）在鱼腹中三日三夜后被活着吐在岸边一样，基督将受死，三日后复活。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus blesses those who listen to his word &ndash; Luke 11:27,28; Matthew 12:46-50; Luke 8:19-21</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣祝福听他话语的人 &ndash; 路加福音11：27-28;  马太福音12：46-50;  路加福音8：19-21</strong></p>
<p>Jesus’ miracle and teaching reached the heart of one woman in the crowd. Unable to keep quiet, she began to cry out. She asked God to bless the mother who had given birth to Jesus. While this was fulfilling Mary’s own prophecy (Luke 1:48), Jesus soon directed attention away from Mary to the blessings God wishes to give to all who believe – “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it” (Luke 11:28).</p>
<p>耶稣的神迹和教导深入会众中一位妇人的心。她无法再保持安静，开始大哭起来。她请求上帝祝福那生了耶稣的母亲。而这正应验了马利亚自己的预言（路加福音1:48），耶稣很快将大家的注意力从马利亚转到祝福上，就是上帝要给所有信的人的福分——“是却还不如听神的道而遵守的人有福”（路11:28）。</p>
<p>About this time Mary, along with Jesus’ half-brothers and half-sisters, appeared. They wished to save Jesus from overworking himself. In a reply which reminds us of an earlier story (Jesus at age 12 in the temple, Luke 2:49), Jesus said that he was doing his Father’s business, building the household of God.</p>
<p>大约在此时，马利亚和耶稣的同母异父的兄弟姐妹们一起出现了。他们想要把耶稣从过度的工作中解救出来。耶稣说他正在以他父的事为念，正在建造上帝的家，他的回答让我们想起之前的一个故事（耶稣12岁时在殿中所说的，路加福音2:49）。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus teaches several kingdom parables &ndash; Matthew 13:1-52</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣教导的几个关于天国的比喻 &ndash; 马太福音13：1-52</strong></p>
<p>By now it was probably mid-afternoon. Jesus and the crowd left the home and went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. There Jesus entered a boat and used it to preach to the crowd which sat on the beach. He spoke in parables.  A parable is “an earthly story with a heavenly meaning”. With simple stories from everyday life, Jesus now taught the people.</p>
<p>现在差不多已经是下午晚些时候了。耶稣和会众离开家去了加利利海的岸边。耶稣上了一艘小船，在船上对着坐在岸上的会众讲道。比喻就是地上的故事指代天国的含义。耶稣现在用日常生活中简单的故事教导人。</p>
<p>Someone might ask why Jesus chose to speak in parables rather than in a sermon. While Christ used parables throughout his ministry, he did so most often when popular opinion was against him. At such times he could openly speak in parables.  Those who believed in him would understand, while those who didn’t would remain confused.</p>
<p>有人可能会问，为什么耶稣选择讲比喻而不是用讲道进行一大通教训。然而在整个传道的过程中，基督都使用比喻，他大多数时候是在大众的观点与他的不同时使用比喻。这时他会公开地讲比喻。那些信他的人会理解比喻的意思，而那些不信的人仍然很疑惑。</p>
<p>What did Jesus’ parables mean? The simplest way for us to determine the meaning of a parable is to follow three simple rules. First, see whether Christ himself gives the meaning. Second, look at the rest of the story to see if that explains the meaning. Usually some event or series of events inspired their use and gives a clue to their meaning. Third, know that each parable has only one central truth.  The details which give color to the earthly story usually add little to the heavenly meaning.</p>
<p>耶稣的比喻是什么意思呢？对于我们来说要确定比喻的意思，最简单的方法就是要遵循三个简单的规则。第一，先看是否基督自己解释了比喻的意思。第二，查看故事其余的部分看看是否有解释。通常有些事件或者一系列的事件会有所启迪，给出线索。第三，要知道每个比喻都仅有一个总的真理在里面。那些渲染前面故事的细节通常对于天国的意义解释甚少。</p>
<p>Jesus spoke eight parables, all concerning the Kingdom of Heaven. The first five were addressed to the crowd on the beach. After that he moved to a house in Capernaum and spoke the last three. The parables are of:</p>
<p>耶稣讲的八个比喻都与天国有关。前面五个是讲给岸边的会众的。随后他到了迦百农讲了后面三个。比喻如下：</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sower and the Seed 撒种</li>
<li>The Weeds among the Wheat 稗子</li>
<li>The Seed Growing by Itself (Mark 4:26-29)种子生长 ( 马可福音4：26-29)</li>
<li>The Mustard Seed 芥菜种</li>
<li>The Yeast 酵母</li>
<li>The Treasure in the Field 地里的财宝</li>
<li>The Pearl of Great Price 昂贵的珠子</li>
<li>The Net Cast into the Sea 撒网</li>
</ol>
<p>Parables 1, 5, 6 and 7 show how the kingdom of God is planted and grows inwardly, in the heart of a person. Parables 2, 3, 4, and 8 show how the kingdom develops outwardly, in the world.</p>
<p>第一，五，六，和七个比喻说明神的天国在种植在人的心里，并向内成长。第二，三，四，和八个比喻说明天国怎样在世界里向外发展。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus heals a man of his leprosy &ndash; Luke 5:12-16</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣医治了一个大麻风病人 &ndash; 路加福音5：12-16</strong></p>
<p>People who were afflicted with leprosy were supposed to remain apart from society.  Their disease was infectious. Yet this man boldly came close to Jesus. This man believed that Jesus could help him, and that Jesus would not ignore him or send him away.</p>
<p>大麻风病人应该在社会之外生活。他们的病是传染病。然而这个人大胆地走近耶稣。他相信耶稣可以医治他，他相信耶稣不会不理他或者打发他走。</p>
<p>Jesus did even more than this man was expecting. Jesus touched him. Jesus was concerned about the sick. Jesus healed this man with a word: “Be clean”.</p>
<p>耶稣做的比他期待的更多。耶稣摸了他，耶稣关心这个病人。耶稣用一句话医治了他：“你洁净了吧。”</p>
<p>Jesus commanded the man to keep quiet about this healing. But the news spread widely. Jesus had to retreat to lonely places so that he had time to do a more important thing.  Jesus needed to pray.</p>
<p>耶稣要求这个人对他被医治的事保持沉默。但是消息却传得很快。耶稣只得退到旷野去做更重要的事。耶稣需要祷告。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus heals a centurion’s servant &ndash; Luke 7:1-10</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣医治了百夫长的仆人 &ndash; 路加福音7：1-10</strong></p>
<p>After his Sermon on the Mount Jesus returned to Capernaum. There some Jewish elders came to Jesus asking him to help a Gentile (non-Jew). They told him about a Roman captain who wished Jesus to heal his sick and dying servant. Of course, Jesus healed the servant.  He even commented, “I have not found such great faith even in Israel” (Luke 7:9).</p>
<p>耶稣在山上讲完道之后就回到迦百农。有几个犹太长老到耶稣那儿请求他帮助一个外邦人（不是犹太人）。他们告诉耶稣，有一个罗马百夫长希望耶稣能医治他的仆人，这仆人害病快要死了。当然耶稣医治了这个仆人。他甚至说：“这么大的信心，就是在以色列中，我也没有遇见过。”（路7：9）。</p>
<p>Luke 7:1-10 reveals what Christ calls a great faith. The captain was humbled because of his sins.  He admitted that he was not worthy of Jesus’ help (vv 6-7a).  Yet he firmly trusted that Jesus was willing and able to help (vv 7b-8). Finally, his faith in God produced good works (vv 4-5) including his concern for his servant’s life (vv 2-3).</p>
<p>路加福音7:1-10的经文中向众人揭示了基督所认为最大的信心。百夫长因为自己的罪而谦卑。他承认自己不配得耶稣的帮助（6-7a节）。然而他坚信耶稣愿意并能够帮助他（7b-8节）。最终他对上帝的信心得到了好结果（4-5节），包括他对仆人生命的关注（2-3节）。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus raises a widow’s son from the dead &ndash; Luke 7:11-17</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣使寡妇的儿子复活 &ndash; 路加福音7：11-17</strong></p>
<p>From Capernaum Jesus, his disciples, and a large crowd traveled about 25 miles to the southwest to the town of Nain. There they witnessed a sad sight. A group of people were carrying a young man who had died to the cemetery.  His mother, a widow, was now left all alone. Jesus had mercy on the mother, touched the coffin and ordered the dead boy to arise. Immediately the young man sat up and spoke. Those who witnessed this miracle should have worshiped Jesus as the Messiah. Instead, many thought he was just another prophet like Elijah or Elisha, who had worked similar miracles (1 Kings 17:21; 2 Kings 4:35). But Jesus did not have to pray first. He could perform this kind of miracle by his own authority and power.</p>
<p>耶稣和门徒还有极多的人从迦百农行走了25英里，到了西南的拿因城。在那儿他们目睹了令人伤心的情景。一群人正抬着一位已经死的年轻人去墓地。他的母亲是个寡妇，如今就只孤零零一个人了。耶稣怜悯他母亲，就按着杠吩咐那死人起来。那年轻人就坐起来，并且说话。那些目睹耶稣所行的神迹的人们本应该敬拜耶稣，称他为弥赛亚。然而很多人认为耶稣只是像以利亚或者以利沙一样的另一先知而已，这两位先知也曾行过相同的神迹（王上17:21；王下4:35）。但是耶稣没有先祷告。他能用自己的权柄和大能行这种神迹。</p>
<p><strong>John’s question and Jesus’ testimony about John &ndash; Luke 7:18-35</strong></p>
<p><strong>约翰的问题以及耶稣关于约翰的见证 &ndash; 路加福音7：18-35</strong></p>
<p>Jesus passed the summer months in Galilee, preaching, teaching, and healing. Meanwhile 70 miles to the south John the Baptist was locked in a prison. It seems that Herod let John’s disciples visit their master from time to time. Some of them must have told John they were confused about Jesus. If he was the Messiah, why did he not come and rescue John the forerunner?</p>
<p>耶稣在加利利度过了整个夏季，讲道、教导、医治。在这期间，施洗约翰被关在从加利利向南70英里的监狱里。从这段经文中看起来似乎希律王让施洗约翰偶尔拜访他们的主。有些人一定已经告诉约翰他们对于耶稣的困惑。如果他是弥赛亚，为什么不来解救先来为他铺平道路的约翰呢？</p>
<p>Rather than answer their questions directly, John sent two of his followers to Jesus. When they found him they asked, “Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?” (Luke 7:19). Jesus answered by inviting them to see for themselves whether he was fulfilling the Old Testament prophecies. They quickly saw that Jesus was fulfilling them!</p>
<p>约翰没有直接回答他们的问题，而是拆了两个门徒到耶稣那里去。当他们找到耶稣时就问：“那将要来的是你吗？还是我们要等候别人呢？”（路加福音7:19）。耶稣通过让邀请他们自己来看看是否他正在实现旧约预言来回答这个问题。他们很快见到了耶稣正在实现那些预言！</p>
<p>As the two disciples left, Jesus looked at the crowd around him. His heart was filled with deep disappointment. Although Jesus was very clear in his teachings and showed that he was God in many ways, many of the people refused to believe or did not immediately believe. There were only a few loyal followers like John. And while some people had accepted John&rsquo;s testimony and baptism, most were like the Pharisees and Scribes. They did not accept but rather laughed at John or spoke evil of his teachings. They thought that demons were causing John to lead such a simple way of life in the desert.  In the same way they would not listen to Jesus. They thought he was not religious enough because he ate and drank like the common people.</p>
<p>这两个门徒走后，耶稣看着周围的会众。他的心充满了深深的失望。尽管耶稣在教导中说得很清楚，也用很多方式显明了他就是上帝，但还是有很多人拒绝相信或者不是立即相信。像约翰这样忠实的门徒只有几个。一些人接受约翰的见证和洗礼，更多的人则像法利赛人和文士一样，心存怀疑。他们不接受，反而嘲笑约翰或者恶言相对耶稣的教导。同样他们不愿听从耶稣。他们认为耶稣不够虔诚，因为他像常人一样又吃又喝。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus is anointed by a sinner at Simon’s house &ndash; Luke 7:36-50</strong></p>
<p><strong>在西门家里耶稣被一个罪人所膏 &ndash; 路加福音7：36-50</strong></p>
<p>By now Jesus was very famous around Galilee. Simon the Pharisee hoped to increase his own social position by inviting Jesus to dinner in his home. While Simon appeared friendly, he did not greet Jesus with a kiss, and he did not have his servants wash Jesus’ dusty feet.  These were the normal ways people showed hospitality to their guests.</p>
<p>迄今为止，耶稣已经闻名于加利利地区周边一带。法利赛人西门想要通过邀请耶稣到家里坐席来提高自己的社会地位。虽然西门表现得很友好，但是他没有用亲吻来问耶稣的安，也没有让仆人洗耶稣已经脏的脚。这是人们殷勤招待宾客正常的方式。</p>
<p>While they were dining, a woman entered the room.  Some people recognized her as a woman who earned money by having sex with men. Now, however, she was crying because of her sin.  She completely humbled herself before Christ, washing his feet with her tears and wiping them with her hair.  Seeing this, the host Simon decided that Jesus really could not be a prophet, because he did not seem to know that this woman was a very bad sinner.  But Jesus did know.  Through a parable he taught that people like this woman who feel their sins most deeply, will love God the most when they come to know his forgiveness. So Jesus assured her that her sins were forgiven, noting that her faith had saved her. Only God can forgive sins. The other dinner guests questioned in their minds by what right Jesus could forgive her those sins. They could still not see that Jesus could do this because he was God.</p>
<p>在他们正吃饭的时候，有一个女人进了屋内。有些人认出她是那靠着与男人上床赚钱的女人。然而此刻她正为自己的罪而哭泣。在基督面前他完全地降卑自己，她用眼泪为耶稣洗脚，并用头发擦干。主人西门见此情景就认定耶稣果真不是先知，因为看上去他不知道这女人是个罪人。耶稣当然知道。他用一个比喻教导人们：像这妇人一样知道自己罪孽深重的人，当他们知道耶稣的宽恕时，将会更爱上帝。因此耶稣确认她的罪赦免了，她的信救了她。只有上帝能够赦罪。同席的人心中疑惑耶稣是靠着什么权利赦免她的罪的。他们依然没无法看到耶稣这事正因为他就是上帝。</p>
<p>Before leaving this story we should talk about who this woman was. Many writers have claimed that she was Mary Magdalene. In fact, today most Christians think of Mary as a converted prostitute or adulteress. But nowhere does Scripture say this. Therefore, we should not either. The Eighth Commandment tells us that we should speak well of people, so we should do the same about Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>在结束这个故事之前，我们应该讨论一下这妇人到底是谁。很多作者断言她就是抹大拉的马利亚。事实上，现在很多基督徒认为马利亚是改变信仰的卖淫女或者奸妇。但经文中没有提到这些。因此，我们也不确定。第八条诫命告诉我们，要说人的好话，所以对抹大拉的马利亚我们也应该如此行。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus is assisted by many women &ndash; Luke 8:1-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>很多妇女帮助耶稣 &ndash; 路加福音8：1-3</strong></p>
<p>The next several weeks, perhaps months, of Christ’s ministry are summarized in three short verses (Luke 8:1-3). Yet, in this brief summary we have answers to two very interesting questions: on what subject did Jesus preach, and where did he get money or food to carry on his ministry?</p>
<p>接下来的几个星期里，或许是几个月的时间里，圣经中用短短的三节经文概述了（路8:1-3）。然而在这短短的叙述中，我们能找到两个有趣的问题的答案：耶稣讲道的主题是什么？继续进行传道所需的钱和实物由哪儿来？</p>
<p>Throughout the villages and cities of Galilee Jesus preached “the good news of the kingdom of God.” In fact, there are three separate instances of Jesus’ preaching in Galilee: first, Mark 1:39 and Luke 4:43; second, Luke 8:1; third, Mark 6:6 and Matt. 9:35. In each case he preached the same message, the good news of the Kingdom of God or Heaven.</p>
<p>走遍加利利各城各乡，耶稣宣讲“神国的福音。”事实上耶稣在加利利的传道包括三个单独的例子：第一，马可福音1:39和路加福音4:43；第二，路加福音8:1；第三，马可福音6:6和马太福音9:35。在每个事例中他都传讲相同的信息，即神国或天国的福音。</p>
<p>Briefly, the Kingdom of God is the rule of God, through the Holy Spirit, in the hearts of believers. Those who through the work of the Spirit believe in Jesus as Savior are no longer subjects of Satan’s Kingdom, but belong to God. Thus Christ preached the gospel. He preached about himself (John 3:16).</p>
<p>简单地说神的国度就是神的规则，贯穿圣灵，在信徒的心中。那些由圣灵做工而信耶稣是救世主的人不再属于撒旦国度了，而属于上帝。因此基督传扬福音。他所传的正是他自己（约翰福音3:16）。</p>
<p>Godly women made freewill offerings so that Jesus and his disciples could devote their full time to ministry.  Among these women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna and Susanna.  They can also teach us how we too can use our time, money and talents the way God would want us to (Christian stewardship). Their faith in Christ led them to show love and do good works.</p>
<p>属神的妇女们自愿奉献，好让耶稣和门徒能全时间去传道。在这妇人中就有抹大拉的马利亚，约亚拿和苏撒拿。他们的行为也教导我们应该如何按照上帝所期望的方式使用我们的时间、金钱和才能（基督徒管理）。他们对基督的信让他们彰显爱并做好的事。</p>

<h3 id="definition-of-parable-比喻的定义">DEFINITION OF PARABLE 比喻的定义</h3>
<p>The Hebrew word (mashal) is here translated as “parables” has as its basic meaning, “comparison”.  Parables teach a lesson by making a comparison between the known and the unknown.  The Greek word (parabole) basically means something placed side by side with something else. Jesus’ parables are stories taken from nature or everyday human experiences and life.  These stories reveal some spiritual, religious or moral truth by illustrating the truth in the story. Parables are comparable to similes and metaphors.   Depending on how they are introduced, they can be called “extended metaphors” or “extended similes”.</p>
<p>在这里翻译为“比喻”的希伯来词（mashal），其基本含义即“比较”。比喻通过比较已知的事和未知的事来教导。希腊词（parabole） 的基本意思是与其他东西并排放置的东西。耶稣的比喻是从自然或人类日常的经历和生活中汲取的故事。这些故事通过阐释故事中的真相揭示了一些属灵的，宗教的或道德的真理。比喻有明喻和隐喻。根据它们的介绍方式，它们可以被称为“扩展隐喻”或“扩展的明喻”。</p>
