<p><strong>Jesus sets his face for Jerusalem &ndash; Luke 9:51-56</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣面向耶路撒冷而去 &ndash; 路加福音9：51-56</strong></p>
<p>After the Feast of the Tabernacles was over, Jesus and the disciples returned to Galilee. Soon, however, Jesus left for Jerusalem once again (Luke 9:51). This time he knew he was on his way to suffer and die for the sins of all mankind.  This time Jesus decided to travel through Samaria, not around it.</p>
<p>住棚节结束后。耶稣和门徒们返回加利利。然而没过多久，他再次启程前往耶路撒冷（路加福音9:51）。这一次他知道他将走上这条为所有人的罪受苦和死亡的路。这一次耶稣决定要穿过撒马利亚地区，而不是绕过她。</p>
<p>With a group of up to 100 people Jesus came near a Samaritan village. The villagers refused to give hospitality to Jesus because he was going to Jerusalem. They felt their own Mt. Gerizim was the holy place for worship. James and John thought that Jesus should call down fire from heaven to destroy the village (2 Kings 1:10-12). The Samaritans refused to receive the One who was to be worshiped, and the disciples forgot that Jesus’ mission was to save, not destroy souls (Luke 9:55).</p>
<p>将近100个人跟随着耶稣来到了撒马利亚的一个村庄附近。因为他们要去耶路撒冷，村民们拒绝热情地款待耶稣。他们觉得自己的基列心山是敬拜的圣地。雅各和约翰认为耶稣应该叫火从天上下来消灭整个村庄（列王记下1:10-12）。撒马利亚人拒绝接受一个将被人们敬拜的人，同时门徒们忘了耶稣的的使命不是消灭灵魂，而是拯救他们（路加福音9:55）。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus heals 10 men who have leprosy	 &ndash; Luke 17:11-19</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣医治了十个麻风病人 &ndash; 路加福音17：11-19</strong></p>
<p>One day as Jesus walked along the border between Samaria and Galilee he heard the cry of ten poor men. They cried out, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!” (Luke 17:13).  They had leprosy for which there was no cure (see Chapter 3).  Jesus told them to go and show themselves to the priests as the Old Testament commanded (see Leviticus 13-14). As they went they were cured.</p>
<p>一天当耶稣正行走到撒马利亚和加利利边界地区时，他听到十个可怜人的哀嚎。他们喊着说：“耶稣，夫子，可怜我们吧！”（路加福音17:13）。他们得了不能治愈的大麻风（参看第三章）。耶稣告诉他们遵照旧约的命令去见祭司，并将他们的身体给祭司查看（参看利未记13-14章）。当他们去的时候，他们就洁净了。</p>
<p>There are several lessons to be learned from this story. First, this ten-in-one miracle shows Jesus’ power. He did not speak to the disease or touch the lepers, but healed them from a distance. From this we can conclude that Jesus even from heaven can help us in with our earthly problems. Second, the lepers showed great faith, for they obeyed Jesus without questioning. We should also remember that faith is accepting Christ and his Word without any doubts. Finally, there is the sad truth that few are “found to return and give praise to God” (Luke 17:18).  This sad fact should help us understand our own lack of thanks and should encourage us to often say “thank you” to God for all his blessings.</p>
<p>从这个故事我们可以学到很多。首先，这个“十合一”的神迹显示了耶稣的能力。他没有谈论这个疾病，也没有碰大麻风病人；而是凭空地医治了他们。由此我们可以知道，即使耶稣是从天上而来，他仍能帮助我们解决地上的需求。其次，大麻风病人显示出极大的信心，因为他们遵照耶稣的命令，毫无质疑。我们也应该记住，信心就是没有任何疑虑地接受基督和他的话语。最后，一个悲哀的真相是很少的人“回来归荣耀与神”（路加福音17:18）。这个让人伤感的事实可以帮助我们明白我们如此缺乏感恩，并且可以鼓励我们因为上帝的祝福，常常地对他说声“感谢”。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus and the 72 &ndash; Luke 10:1-24</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣和七十二门徒 &ndash; 路加福音10：1-24</strong></p>
<p>The unfriendly Samaritans did not stop Jesus from his mission or cool his love for sinful mankind. Soon he sent 72 disciples on a preaching tour. The instructions they received were similar to those given the Twelve Apostles earlier (see Chapter 6).</p>
<p>这些不友好的撒玛利亚人并没有让耶稣停止他的使命，或让他对罪人的爱冷淡下来。很快耶稣差派72个门徒开始他们的宣教旅程。耶稣给他们的教导与此前他给十二使徒的如出一辙（参见第六章）。</p>
<p>There were several reasons for sending out the disciples at this particular time. First, just as Jesus had sent two disciples on ahead into the Samaritan village to announce his coming, so the 72 would go into areas where he was not well known (Perea, Judea) and prepare for his arrival. Second, Jesus knew he did not have many more days on earth. Others would have to continue his work. This preaching tour would serve as on-the-job training for such ministers.</p>
<p>在这个特别的时期，有好几个原因将这些门徒差派出去。首先，就像耶稣差派了两个门徒，在他们之前进入撒玛利亚的村庄，去宣告耶稣的到来一样；这72个人将进入那些对耶稣不甚了解的区域（庇哩亚，犹大），并预备好耶稣的到来。其次，耶稣知道他在世的时候不多了。其他人将要继续他的工作。这次宣教之旅将通过实践来训练这些宣教士们。</p>
<p>The results of the preaching tour were great. The message of Jesus struck hard at Satan. Then Christ said a prayer like one of his earlier ones (Matthew 11:25-27).</p>
<p>宣教之旅的结果是美好的。耶稣的信息沉重地打击了撒旦。随后，基督向他此前一样，献上了一个祷告（参看马太福音11:25-27）。</p>
<p>Elsewhere things were very much the same. The cities of Korizin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum are cases in point. During his ministry Jesus had visited the first two of these cities and had performed mighty miracles. Then there was Capernaum, the most honored of all cities, Jesus’ mission headquarters. There the local people had witnessed many of his miracles.</p>
<p>在别处事情也照样发生。哥拉汛、伯赛大好迦百农是例证。耶稣在传道过程中到过前面的的两个城，并行了大神迹。然后来到迦百农，是所有城中最具荣光的城，也是耶稣布道的中心。在迦百农当地的百姓见证了很多奇迹。</p>
<p>While it is true that the people of these cities were impressed by Jesus’ miracles and flocked to see him and to have him satisfy their needs, nevertheless, “they did not repent” (Matthew 11:20). To them, Jesus was a doer of good deeds, not a long awaited and much needed Savior from sin. Consequently, Jesus pronounced a curse. On Judgment Day it would be more tolerable for the pagans of ancient Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom than for the three cities of Jesus’ day. (By the way, this story also shows that there are different amounts of suffering in hell.)</p>
<p>这些城的百姓对耶稣所行的神迹印象深刻，而且成群结队地去见耶稣，让耶稣满足他们的需要，然而，“他们不悔改”（太11:20）。对于他么你来说耶稣做好事的实干家，不是一直等待到来的、更需要的将他们从罪中拯救的救世主。因此，耶稣宣告了一个咒诅。到审判的日子，推罗、西顿和所多玛所受的，比耶稣在世的这三个城要容易受。（顺便说一下，这个故事也表明了在地狱里所要受的苦是有分别的。）</p>
<p>In spite of so many unbelievers Christ’s ministry was like a fruit tree - it did produce fruit or results. As promised (Isaiah 55:11), God&rsquo;s Word does change the hearts of people. Looking on the brighter side, Jesus thanked his Father for those whose hearts had been changed.  Finally, to show that God’s grace was for everyone, Jesus invited all people to exchange the guilt of their sins for his spiritual rest, peace and security.</p>
<p>尽管有很多不信的人，基督的传道像果树一样——的的确确生出果子或者卓有成效。正如先知书所预言的一样（赛55:11）上帝的道让百姓心意更新。耶稣看到令人高兴的一面，为那些心意已经改变的人向上帝献上感谢。最终，为了显明上帝的恩典是给每个人的，耶稣邀请所有会众用他的灵魂的安息、安心和安全替代他们罪的捆绑。</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Good Samaritan &ndash; Luke 10:25-37</strong></p>
<p><strong>好撒马利亚人的比喻 &ndash; 路加福音10:25-37</strong></p>
<p>The next several events recorded by St. Luke (10:25-13:21) cannot be put into exact order. However, we will follow the order given in Luke’s Gospel.</p>
<p>我们无法准确地知道圣路加接下来所记载的一些事件发生的顺序。不管怎样，我们可以遵循路加福音中记载的顺序。</p>
<p>The parable of the Good Samaritan is one of the best known in all of Scripture. Today people who help others are often called Good Samaritans. Hospitals are often given this name.  Most people think this parable teaches us that God wants us to help our fellow human beings.</p>
<p>好撒马利亚人的比喻是圣经中最著名的故事之一。今天那些帮助了其他人的人常被称作好撒马利亚人。医院经常以此命名。很多人认为这个比喻教导我们，上帝希望我们帮助我们的同路人。</p>
<p>However, the parable was spoken to answer a question about salvation, not about being a good neighbor. An expert in the law came to Jesus asking, “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus asked the man what he thought. The expert then quoted Deuteronomy 6:4-5 and Leviticus 19:18 (words which were said every morning and evening by religious Jews).  When Jesus told the man to obey those commands, the man asked who his neighbor was.  Jesus then told the man this parable.  It did not answer the question “Who is my neighbor?” but “Whose neighbor am I?” If the expert in the law had taken this parable to heart he would have confessed his own sinfulness and would have admitted his need of a Savior.</p>
<p>然而，这个比喻是在回答一个关于救赎的问题，而不是关于做一个好的邻舍。一个旅法师来见耶稣说：“我该做什么才可以承受永生？”耶稣问这个人他的想法。律法师引用了申命记6:4-5和利未记19:18节的经文（犹太教徒每个早晨和晚上所说的话）。当耶稣告诉这个人要遵守这些命令时，他又问“谁是我的邻舍呢？”随后，耶稣给他讲了这个比喻。这个比喻没有回答“谁是我的邻舍呢？”这个问题。但是回答了“我是谁的邻舍呢？”如果这个律法师将这个比喻放在心中，他定会认自己的罪，并且承认他需要一个救主。</p>
<p><strong>Questions about marriage and divorce  &ndash; Matthew 19:3-12;  Mark 10:2-12</strong></p>
<p><strong>关于结婚和离婚的问题 &ndash; 马太福音19：3-12  马可福音10：2-12</strong></p>
<p>By now it was March of A.D. 30.  For six months Jesus had wandered throughout Perea, Judea, and into Samaria.  However, during this time he was coming always closer to his death. Now he visited Perea for the last time, and from there went on towards Jerusalem.</p>
<p>时间已经来到公元30年的三月。六个月来，耶稣都游走在庇哩亚、犹大和撒马利亚地区。无论如何，在这段时间里耶稣都离他的死亡越来越近。现在他最后一次拜访庇哩亚，并会从那里前往耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>Jesus’ first miracle was at the wedding in Cana.  Now near the end of his ministry the subject of marriage was raised.  In Deuteronomy 24:1 Moses spoke about divorce.  During Jesus’ time followers of the famous Jewish teacher Hillel thought this verse meant a man could divorce his wife for almost any reason, including burning his dinner.  The followers of the teacher Shammai, on the other hand, said that people could divorce only when there was a moral sin by one, but that might be as simple as a woman appearing on the street without a veil covering her face. The Pharisees now asked Jesus about divorce hoping that he would take sides in the argument. Jesus refused to do this. Instead, he spoke about what a marriage is and that it is God’s plan that husband and wife remain married for life.</p>
<p>耶稣所行的第一个神迹是在迦拿的婚宴上。现在，临近他传道工作的尽头时，有关婚姻的话题再次被提及。在申命记24:1节中，摩西谈到关于离婚的事情。在耶稣的时代，著名的犹太教师希勒尔（Hillel）的学生们认为这节经文的意思是，一个男人可以以任何理由与他的妻子离婚，包括烧焦了饭。另外，教师撒买（Shammai）的学生们则说，只有在其中一方违背道德律法而犯罪的时候，人们可以离婚；但是罪行可能只是一个女人没有以面纱遮面，而出现在街上这样的行为。法利赛人如今问耶稣离婚的事情，希望耶稣将会站在某一种立场上。但是耶稣拒绝这样做。取而代之的是，他谈到婚姻是什么，以及丈夫和妻子一生持守婚姻是上帝的计划。</p>
<p>Was Moses wrong in granting divorce?  Jesus pointed out that Moses did not command or favor divorce, but only permitted it, and only then as a way of avoiding further sin. The Old Testament says Christians are allowed to divorce only in cases of adultery. Later in the New Testament Paul says that abandonment is also a proper reason for divorce (1 Corinthians 7:15).</p>
<p>摩西准许离婚的行为错了吗？耶稣指出，摩西并非赞同离婚；他只是允许离婚，并且只是作为避免继续犯罪的一种办法。旧约中提到基督徒只有在犯了奸淫的时候才允许离婚。随后在新约中保罗提到，被不信的配偶遗弃也是一个合适的离婚理由（哥林多前书7:15）。</p>
<p>Should men remain single? No. Man is suited for a married life. But some men may remain unmarried if they are able to live that way without being tempted to sin.</p>
<p>男人应该持守单身吗？不是的。婚姻的生活对男人是合宜的。但是当某些人能够持守单身而不受罪的试探时，他们当然可以那么做。</p>
<p>One of the reasons for marriage was to raise children.  Jesus held little children in his arms and blessed them. He made it clear that the Kingdom of God is for them, too. In other words, because little children are sinners, Christ also wants them to come to faith and receive his forgiveness.</p>
<p>婚姻存在的原因之一是生儿育女。耶稣怀抱着孩子们并为他们祝福。他十分清楚地表明，上帝的国度也是为他们预备的。换句话说，小孩子们也是罪人，基督同样希望他们相信并接受他的赦免。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus and the little children &ndash; Luke 18:15-17</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣和小孩子 &ndash; 路加福音18：15-17</strong></p>
<p>Jesus defended and shared the gospel with people in society who were otherwise ignored or ostracized.  Jesus invited all people, women and men; adults and children to be saved through faith in him.</p>
<p>耶稣为社会中被忽视或被排斥的人辩护并与他们分享福音。耶稣邀请所有的人，无论男女老少，都要因着对他的信心得救。</p>
<p>In this account, Jesus defends the children. Even his own disciples didn’t understand how precious the children are to Jesus.  When parents brought their children – even the infants! – to Jesus, the Twelve tried to send the parents away with their children.  Jesus rebuked his disciples.  Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me!”</p>
<p>在这个记述中，耶稣为孩子们辩护。就连他自己的门徒也不明白孩子们对耶稣有多珍贵。当父母带着他们的孩子-甚至婴儿！-来到耶稣面前时，十二个门徒要把父母和他们的孩子一起送走。耶稣责备他的门徒。耶稣说：“让小孩子到我这里来。”</p>
<p>We do well to remember this important truth about children.  Children who believe in Jesus are an example of humble faith for us to imitate.</p>
<p>我们最好记住这个关于孩子的重要事实。相信耶稣的孩子是我们可以效法的谦卑信仰的榜样。</p>
<p><strong>The rich young man &ndash; Luke 18:18-27</strong></p>
<p><strong>有钱的年轻人 &ndash; 路加福音18：18-27</strong></p>
<p>As Jesus continued on his journey a rich young ruler came and asked: “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?” The man was trying to earn his own salvation. If a person would save himself he must obey the Law perfectly. While the young man felt he had done just that, Jesus opened his eyes. The man loved his money more than God, a breaking of the first commandment.</p>
<p>耶稣继续着他的旅程，一个富有的青年官来问他：“夫子，我该做什么善事才能得永生？ ”这个青年人尝试着赚取他自己的救恩。如果一个人让自己得救，他必须完美地遵守律法。当这个年轻人觉得他已经做到了的时候，耶稣让他明白。相比上帝，这个人更加爱慕钱财，这违背了第一条诫命的要求。</p>
<p>If a person cannot save himself, how can he be saved?  Jesus’ answer was clear, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:26). A person is saved by the gracious will of God which the sinner only accepts.</p>
<p>如果一个人不能救他自己，他如何能得救呢？耶稣的回答非常清楚：“在人这是不能的，在神凡事都能。（马太福音19:26）”人得救是靠着上帝美好的旨意，他只要接受即可。</p>
<p><strong>Heavenly rewards for those who follow Jesus in service &ndash; Luke 18:28-30</strong></p>
<p><strong>赐给跟随耶稣服事之人的天国赏赐 &ndash; 路加福音18：28-30</strong></p>
<p>Does it cost to follow Jesus?  Yes, it does. Is the cost worth it?  Yes, it is. In this life we may have to say farewell to things and to people in order to follow the Lord’s will and fulfill our calling.  But the Lord is able to restore our losses. Perhaps the Lord will do this already in this life. But the Lord will certainly do this in eternity. He will give us much more than we may have lost in this life.</p>
<p>跟随耶稣有代价的吗？是的，有的。付出的代价值得吗？是的，值得。 在这一生中，为了顺服主的旨意，完成我们的呼召，我们可能不得不对某些事物和人说再见。但是主能够弥补我们的损失。也许主在今生已经这样做了，但主必定会在永恒里这样做。他会给我们比我们今生可能失去的多得多。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus in Jerusalem for Dedication (Hanukkah) &ndash; John 10:22-44</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣在耶路撒冷参加修殿节(光明节)&ndash; 约翰福音10：22-44</strong></p>
<p>Sometime near mid-December Jesus reached Jerusalem where he celebrated the Feast of Dedication (Hanukkah). The feast itself was a small festival in the Jewish calendar remembering the time in 165 B.C. when the temple was cleansed after having been made unclean by Gentiles. Since both the temple and homes were brightly lit with candles, the celebration was called the Festival of Lights. It was appropriate that the “true light” of the world (John 1:9) should once again shine forth in the temple, but as John (1:5) said, “The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.”</p>
<p>将近十二月中旬的时候，耶稣到达了耶路撒冷，并参与庆祝修殿节（也称光明节）。在犹太历法里这只是一个很小的节日，为的是纪念公元前165年，被外邦人玷污的圣殿得以洁净。届时圣殿和家里都会点上明亮的蜡烛，因此庆典也被称为光明节。这样做是为了感激世上“真光”（约翰福音1:9）将再次在圣殿中光芒四射，但就像约翰（约翰福音1:5）说的一样：“光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。”</p>
<p>It was a cold winter day as Jesus walked along the temple porch, but the real chill was in the hearts of many. Jewish religious leaders crowded around Jesus.  They were still demanding proof that he was the Messiah. He had given such proof before, but they had refused to believe it.</p>
<p>当耶稣行走在圣殿的廊下是，正值寒冬，但是真正的寒冷却是在很多人的心中。犹太人拥挤着耶稣。他们还是要得到耶稣是弥赛亚的证据。此前耶稣已经很多次证明了这点，但是犹太人门却拒绝相信。</p>
<p>The words Jesus spoke to these hardened unbelievers are still comforting to Christians today. God the Father and God the Son, equal in power, knowledge, and love, work as a team to preserve the believers.</p>
<p>耶稣讲给数以百计不信者的话语，今天仍旧安慰着基督徒们。天父上帝和上帝的儿子，有同样的能力，知识和爱，他们在一起协作保守每一个信徒。</p>
<p>The Jewish leaders tried to extinguish the Light with stones, so the Lord and his disciples went back to Perea. There they remained for a time.</p>
<p>犹太人试图用石头“熄灭真光”，所以主和他的门徒们启程返回了庇哩亚，并在那里停留了一段时间。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus rebukes the Jewish Leaders &ndash; Luke 11:37-54</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣斥责犹太人的领袖  &ndash;  路加福音11：37-54</strong></p>
<p>Today it is popular to think that Jesus was a gentle person. Many people cannot believe Jesus could be as harsh as his words in Luke 11:37-54. But we must simply accept the simple words of Scripture.  Jesus’ love was great even for the Pharisees and lawyers.  He struck fear in their hearts with these strong words.  He tried to wake them up from their false beliefs. Thus Jesus accused the Pharisees of just going through the actions of religion, of doing good outwardly while inside their souls were spiritually dead. The experts of religious law were even worse. They were not only fooling themselves; they were taking others to hell with them.</p>
<p>今天流行的想法是，耶稣是一个很好的人。很多人不相信耶稣会像路加福音11:37-54节中，说那么严厉的话。但是我们必须单纯地理解圣经上简单的话语。对于法利赛人和律法师，耶稣的爱一样是极大的。通过这些强有力的话语，耶稣击打着他们心中的恐惧。他试图将他们从错误的信仰中唤醒。因此耶稣职责法利赛人，批评他们只关心宗教的行为，批评他们表面做的好，但他们里面的灵已经死了。律法师甚至更糟糕。他们不只使自己愚拙；还拉上别人一同下地狱。</p>
<p>Jesus’ warnings did not lead to the result he wished. Instead, the Pharisees and lawyers continued to ask him questions hoping he would say something wrong so they could attack him.</p>
<p>耶稣的警告没有达到预期的效果。与之相反，法利赛人和律法师继续问他问题，希望抓到他话中的把柄，然后他们就可以攻击耶稣。</p>
<h2 id="be-prepared-for-gods-judgment-为上帝的审判做准备">Be Prepared For God’s Judgment 为上帝的审判做准备</h2>
<p><strong>Fear God above men &ndash; Luke 12:1-12</strong></p>
<p><strong>敬畏上帝高于敬畏人 &ndash; 路加福音12：1-12</strong></p>
<p>Jesus now turned to his disciples, warned them against the Pharisees’ teaching, and encouraged them in their defense of the gospel. It should not surprise us that Jesus repeated statements he had made earlier. After all, good teachers often repeat their main points.</p>
<p>耶稣现在转向他的门徒们，警告他们防备法利赛人的教导，并激励他们为福音辩护。不出所料，耶稣重复了他此前的宣告。毕竟所有好的老师都经常重复他们认为重要的见解</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Rich Fool &ndash; Luke 12:13-21</strong></p>
<p><strong>富有傻瓜的比喻 &ndash; 路加福音12：13-21</strong></p>
<p>While Jesus was speaking to the disciples, a crowd gathered to see the man who had been so bold as to argue with the Pharisees. Then someone in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me” (Luke 12:13).</p>
<p>当耶稣对门徒说话的时候，一群人聚集而来，要看看这个敢于和法利赛人争论的人。随后，人群中的一些人问耶稣：“夫子，请你吩咐我的兄长和我分开家业。”（路加福音12:13）。</p>
<p>This person was not interested in Jesus’ message of joy, peace, and pardon; he was only interested in his own financial affairs. Jesus answered, “Man, who appointed me to be a judge between you?” (Luke 12:14). Jesus refused to consider his case.  He was saying that the spiritual and earthly kingdoms are and must be kept separate. Fifteen centuries later the leaders of the Lutheran church wrote:</p>
<p>这个人对耶稣喜乐、平安和赦免的信息不感兴趣；他只关心他自己的财产问题。耶稣回答说：“你这个人，谁立我做你们断事的官呢？”（路加福音12:14）。耶稣拒绝考虑他的问题。他教导说属灵的国度和地上的过国度是分开的，并且一定不要混为一谈。十五个世纪之后，路德宗教会的领袖们写道：</p>
<p>“Therefore, church and government are not to be mixed up. The power of the church has its own mission to preach the Gospel and offer the sacraments. It should not interfere in the job of the government, nor help appoint rulers in the world, nor set aside government laws, nor stop people from obeying the law, nor interfere with decisions about any government laws or agreements, nor insist to government rulers which laws should be set up to regulate the form of government. For Christ says, “My kingdom is not of this world,” and again, “Who made me a judge over you?”</p>
<p>“然而，教会和政府不要混淆不清。教会的能力有他自己的使命，就是传讲福音并施行圣礼。教会不应该干涉政府的工作；不能帮助任命世上的官员；不应拒绝政府的法律；不能阻止人们遵纪守法；不干涉任何关于政府法律和条约的决定；也不坚持要求政府的官员们，应该设立某一条法律来治理政体。因为基督说：‘我的国不在这地上’以及‘谁让我为你们断事呢？’.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Worry; Keep Watch &ndash; Luke 12:22-59</strong></p>
<p><strong>不要忧虑；一直警醒 &ndash; 路加福音12：22-59</strong></p>
<p>This question of the man in the crowd made Jesus so concerned that he began to discuss attitudes toward earthly possessions. In the parable of the rich fool he warned against selfishness and greed. Turning to the disciples he taught them not to worry. The two sins are cousins. “Greed can never get enough, worry is afraid it might not have enough.”</p>
<p>这个人群中某人的问题，让耶稣如此关注，以致他开始讨论对于世上财富的态度。在富有的傻瓜的比喻里，他警告那些自私和贪婪的人。对与他的门徒们，耶稣则教导他们不要忧虑。这两个罪是表兄弟‘贪婪永不满足，忧虑则担心拥有可能不足够。’”</p>
<p>The man of God must always be prepared for Christ’s Second Coming as Jesus himself taught.  He must not become wrapped up in earthly matters. Before that coming, however, difficult trials will happen to people. The cross divides mankind. Disciples who are faithful, unlike others, respond to these warning signs.</p>
<p>如耶稣自己教导的那样，上帝的子民必须常常准备好迎接基督的第二次降临。他一定不再纠缠于那些世俗之事。然而，他来之前，艰难的考验会临到人们身上。十字架使人类被分别开来。那些忠实的门徒们和其他人不同，他们对这些警告的信号有所回应。</p>
<p><strong>Repent or Perish &ndash; Luke 13:1-9</strong></p>
<p><strong>悔改或灭亡  &ndash; 路加福音13：1-9</strong></p>
<p>Jesus’ warnings about judgment day started the crowd thinking. Remember that Jews often thought disasters were God’s punishment for particular sins. Therefore, they decided that this was the right time to discuss the matter of a recent temple tragedy. Roman soldiers had killed some Galileans who had been offering sacrifices. Jesus noted that this and another tragic event where punishments on individual sins. Rather, they were signs meant to warn of God’s coming judgment on all those who had not repented. To make this point Jesus spoke a parable about a fig tree that produced no fruit.</p>
<p>耶稣关于审判日的警告开始于人群的思考。还记得吗？犹太人常常认为灾难都是上帝对特别之罪的惩罚。所以，他们决定这正是绝佳的时机，来讨论一件最近发生在圣殿中的悲剧。罗马士兵杀害了一些献祭的加利利人。耶稣提到此事，也提到另一件惩罚个别犯罪的不幸事件。当然，这些信号都是对那些还没有悔改的人，发出上帝那即将审判的警告。为了表明这点，耶稣说了一个无花果树不产果子的比喻。</p>

<p>c.	What does this statement tell you about the One who says these things?</p>
<p>这个陈述告诉你说这话的人是什么人？</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read Luke 10:1.  Think:  Why did Jesus send out these followers “two by two”?  Is this still a good strategy for the church to use when doing evangelism?</p>
<p>请读路加福音10：1。想一想：耶稣为什么差遣门徒“两个两个地”出去？这仍然是教会在传福音时的好策略吗？</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review Luke 13:1-9.  How does the parable of the fig tree fit the occasion on which Jesus taught this parable?</p>
<p>请读路加福音13：1-9。无花果树的比喻如何适合耶稣教导这个比喻的场合？</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digging Deeper:  Jesus certainly taught the same lesson or gave the same warning more than once.  Give an example from chapter 9 of a warning or a lesson which Jesus taught on at least one other occasion.</p>
<p>更深层的挖掘：耶稣肯定会给我们同样的教训，或者不止一次地发出同样的警告。举出第9章中耶稣至少在另一个场合所教导的警告或教训的例子。</p>
