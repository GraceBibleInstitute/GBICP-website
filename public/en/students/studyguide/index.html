	<h1>Study Plan</h1>
	
	<h2 id="curriculum-objectives">CURRICULUM OBJECTIVES</h2>
<p>Grace Bible Institute will offer a variety of courses to meet the needs of these students:</p>
<p>a) Christians who are seeking personal spiritual enrichment and receive sound Biblical teaching from a skilled and loving Christian faculty.
b) Pastors, preachers, and other professional church workers who are seeking help to improve their ministry skills and become more Gospel-focused in their teaching and preaching.
c) Christians who would like to prepare themselves for a service role in a small home-based fellowship group.
Students may work toward one of three different certificates (see below) or simply take courses for personal enrichment.</p>
<h2 id="certificates-and-graduations">CERTIFICATES AND GRADUATIONS</h2>
<p>Students who complete one of the three study programs listed below will be awarded a certificate and may be recommended for continued study toward an advanced degree that will qualify them to serve in a role that will advance the Christian church in China. Grace Bible Institute now offers these three study programs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Biblical Studies Certificate
This plan of study will provide a student with a general knowledge of the Bible and a deeper knowledge of several important books of the Bible.  This certification will better prepare a student to be a Bible teacher. The Biblical Studies Certificate will be awarded to those who complete:
a. 4 required doctrine courses (201, 202, 203, and 204)
b. 6 Biblical Studies courses of his or her choice
c. 2 courses the student chooses from other areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Christian Ministry Certificate
This plan of study will provide a student who is already serving in a ministry position in a local congregation with a solid foundation in Christian doctrine and also with training in some important areas of Christian ministry. The Christian Ministry Certificate will be awarded to those who complete:
a. 10 required courses as indicated in the chart below
b. 2 elective courses of the student’s choosing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Christian Studies Certificate
This plan of study is designed for the student who wishes to continue on into either the Diploma of Christian Leadership program or the Deaconess program of Grace Bible Institute. The Christian Studies Certificate will be awarded to those who complete:
a. The 13 required courses as indicated in the chart below.<br>
b. Note: A student may also take any elective courses, but is not required to do so for this certificate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Details about the courses required for each certificate following the chart below.
The Graduation ceremonies for students who earn one of these three certificates will be held at a location to be determined by the graduate and representatives from GBI and will be held annually or as often as practical.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling">SCHEDULING</h2>
<p>Grace Bible Institute Curriculum typically offers two semesters each year. Each semester is usually 16 weeks in length. study.
Some courses are shorter than 16 weeks, and we may offer a second shorter course to students who finish some of these shorter courses.</p>
<h2 id="educational-level">EDUCATIONAL LEVEL</h2>
<p>These courses have been prepared for adult Christians who have a basic knowledge of the Bible and its teachings. Therefore, these courses will be written at a level similar to the courses that would be used at a Christian Bible college.</p>
<h2 id="graduate-programs">GRADUATE PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>Graduates of Grace Bible Institute will have the opportunity to enroll in one of two schools of study for an appropriate service role in the public ministry within a Christian fellowship.</p>
<p>The first program of study would be the Diploma of Christian Leadership program. This program would prepare men to serve as a leader of a small home-based fellowship under the guidance and supervision of a Chinese pastor. There are 8 courses in this program.</p>
<p>The second program of study would be the Deaconess Ministry Certification program. This program would prepare women to serve as a deaconess within the ministry of small home-based fellowship or fellowship network. The course of study for this program is still under development.</p>
