&lt;p&gt;Introduction to the Study of Christian Doctrine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 1 – The Study of Christian Doctrine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALS bilingual pdf file: Chapter 1 pages 1-6 [NPH: pages 3-6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson we will learn that all the truths of the Bible fit together and work together to bring us to Jesus.  Jesus is the center of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the hub of a wheel is the center of the wheel, so Jesus is the center of Christian doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every spoke of a wheel points toward the hub and every spoke of a wheel moves out from the hub.  Every book of the Bible, every chapter and verse of the Bible is there to help us to know Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one way for sinners to be saved from sin and possess eternal life.  Jesus is that Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one way to meet and to know Jesus by faith.  That way is the Bible, the inspired Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 12:20-22 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.” Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let this be your purpose and your prayer every time you study the Bible:  “I want to see Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;athe-core-center-of-the-teaching-of-christian-doctrine&#34;&gt;A.	The core (center) of the teaching of Christian doctrine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1jesus-jesus-only-jesus&#34;&gt;1.	Jesus, Jesus, Only Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	Jesus is the center of Christian doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 5:39 You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 20:31 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 19:10  …the testimony about Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. (EHV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	Jesus is this world’s one and only Savior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 4:12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 14:16 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.	Jesus is the Church’s One Message to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 2:2  For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 16:15 (Jesus) said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2one-way-to-be-saved&#34;&gt;2.	One Way to be saved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	The Bible is the only source of Christian doctrine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 8:19-20  When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? Consult God’s instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 16:31 “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	The Bible teaches salvation by God’s grace alone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 11:6  And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.	God’s grace is received by faith alone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 6:28-29 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?”  Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3the-correct-understanding-of-law-and-gospel-is-necessary-to-understand-holy-scripture&#34;&gt;3.	The correct understanding of Law and Gospel is necessary to understand Holy Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	Failure to use the Law correctly leads to a religion of works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 18:11-12 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	Failure to use the Gospel correctly leads sinners to despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 27:3-5  When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. “I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.” “What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.” So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4the-doctrine-of-the-means-of-grace-is-a-key-doctrine&#34;&gt;4.	The doctrine of the means of grace is a key doctrine.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	God is present among us in word and sacrament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 55:6 Seek the LORD while he may be found; call on him while he is near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 18:20 For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	God uses word and sacrament to save us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 55:10-11 As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 6:63 The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bthe-bible-is-the-only-source-and-standard-for-a-christians-faith-and-life&#34;&gt;B.	The Bible is the only source and standard for a Christian’s faith and life.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1the-bible-is-gods-word-to-the-world&#34;&gt;1.	The Bible is God’s Word to the World.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	God’s Word to the world was passed on by word of mouth from Adam until Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I will put enmity
between you and the woman,
and between your offspring and hers;
he will crush your head,
and you will strike his heel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	God gave his Word to Moses and the other prophets who spoke and wrote God’s Word prior to the birth of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua 1:7-8 “Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.  Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 23:35  And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.	Jesus brought God’s final Word to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 1:1-2 In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2the-bible-is-the-only-source-of-christian-doctrine&#34;&gt;2.	The Bible is the only source of Christian Doctrine.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	God forbids us to add to the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 4:2 Do not add to what I command you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 22:18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	God forbids us to take anything out of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 4:2 …and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 4:32 See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 22:19 And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion-time&#34;&gt;DISCUSSION TIME&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;students-questions&#34;&gt;STUDENTS’ QUESTIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

Introduction to the Study of Christian Doctrine基督教教义学习简介&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 1 – The Study of Christian Doctrine
第一章——基督教教义学习&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction
简介
In lesson 1 we learned that the correct approach to Christian doctrine is this:  “The Word of God – and no one else, not even an angel – should establish articles of faith.” (Smalcald Articles II II:15)
在第一课，我们学到，对待基督教教义的正确态度是：“神的话——除此以外没有别的，天使也不行——才是信心的依据。”（施马加登信条II II:15）
In this lesson we will consider those Christian churches and non-Christian religions (cults) which do not observe this approach.  We will also consider the sad consequences that come when these churches and religions search for their truth in other places and through other methods.
本课我们将要学习的基督教教会以及非基督教宗教（异教）并不持守这样的态度。这些教会和宗教在其他的地方、以其他的方式来寻求真理，以致产生了可悲的后果，我们对此也会有所了解。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8:31  To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. 32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
约8:31 耶稣对信他的犹太人说，你们若常常遵守我的道，就真是我的门徒。
Learn and remember the warnings this lesson gives:  Do not depend on your reason or human tradition to establish Christian truth. Do not lose the centrality of Jesus and the Bible.
学习并且谨记本课所提出的教训：建立基督教真理不能依靠自己的理性或者人的传统。要以耶稣和圣经为中心，不能离开。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other approaches to the study of Christian doctrine
学习基督教教义的其他途径&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Christian Churches
其他基督教教会
a.	Roman Catholicism: Scripture and Tradition
罗马天主教会：圣经和传统&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 7:5-8  So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?”
He replied, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written:
“‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.’
You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.” 
可7:5-8 法利赛人和文士问他说，你的门徒为什么不照古人的遗传，用俗手吃饭呢？耶稣说，以赛亚指着你们假冒为善之人所说的预言，是不错的，如经上说，这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。他们将人的吩咐，当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。你们是离弃神的诫命，拘守人的遗传。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	The Orthodox church:  Scripture and Tradition
东正教教会：圣经和传统&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 8:20  Consult God’s instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.
赛8:20 人当以训诲和法度为标准。他们所说的，若不与此相符，必不得见晨光。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 23:8-12  “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.  Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant.  For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
太23:8-12 但你们不要受拉比的称呼。因为只有一位是你们的夫子。你们都是弟兄。也不要称呼地上的人为父。因为只有一位是你们的父，就是在天上的父。也不要受师尊的称呼。因为只有一位是你们的师尊，就是基督。你们中间谁为大，谁就要作你们的用人。凡自高的必降为卑，自卑的必升为高。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Peter 1:19-21 We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
彼后1:19-21 我们并有先知更确的预言，如同灯照在暗处。你们在这预言上留意，直等到天发亮晨星在你们心里出现的时候，才是好的。第一要紧的，该知道经上所有的预言，没有可随私意解说的。因为预言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动说出神的话来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.	The Reformed churches: Scripture and Reason
改革宗教会：圣经和理性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human reason is a great gift from God.  Reason is our ability to discover the way God’s world works.  The scientist and Christian, Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), said that by studying the world we are able to “think God’s thoughts after Him.”&lt;br&gt;
人的理性是神的一项美好恩赐。理性使得我们能够发现神所创造世界的运行规律。作为科学家和基督徒，约翰尼斯·开普勒(1571-1630)说，通过学习这个世界，我们可以“像神一样思考”。
But we must not use our reason to determine whether or not what the Bible says is true.  The Bible reveals some things that do not make logical sense.  For example, how can the bread and wine of the Lord’s Supper be Jesus’ body and blood?  The doesn’t make logical sense.&lt;br&gt;
但是，我们不可用自己的理性来决定圣经所说的是否是真理。圣经所启示的有些真理并不能为逻辑所解释。例如，主餐的饼和杯怎么会是耶稣的身体和血呢？这并不合逻辑。
The following passage shows us that our reason must not rule over the Bible.  We will use our reason to understand what the Bible says.  But we must not use our reason to determine if what the Bible says is true or not.
下面的经文告诉我们，我们的理性并不能凌驾于圣经之上。我们可以使用理性来学习圣经。但是我们并不能决定圣经所说是否是真理。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 10:4-5  The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. 
林后10:4-5 我们争战的兵器，本不是属血气的，乃是在神面前有能力可以攻破坚固的营垒，将各样的计谋，各样拦阻人认识神的那些自高之事，一概攻破了，又将人所有的心意夺回，使他都顺服基督。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cults:  special revelations and private interpretations
异教：特殊启示和个人解释&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 23:25-28   “I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the LORD.
耶23:25-28 我已听见那些先知所说的，就是托我名说的假预言，他们说，我作了梦。我作了梦。
说假预言的先知，就是预言本心诡诈的先知，他们这样存心要到几时呢？他们各人将所作的梦对邻舍述说，想要使我的百姓忘记我的名，正如他们列祖因巴力忘记我的名一样。得梦的先知可以述说那梦。得我话的人可以诚实讲说我的话。糠秕怎能与麦子比较呢？这是耶和华说的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Timothy 2:16-18   Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.  Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.
提后2:16-18 但要远避世俗的虚谈。因为这等人必进到更不敬虔的地步。他们的话如同毒疮，越烂越大。其中有许米乃和腓理徒。他们偏离了真道，说复活的事已过，就败坏好些人的信心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians 2:8   See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ.
【西2:8】 你们要谨慎，恐怕有人用他的理学，和虚空的妄言，不照着基督，乃照人间的遗传，和世上的小学，就把你们掳去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 1:8-9   But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!
加1:8-9 但无论是我们，是天上来的使者，若传福音给你们，与我们所传给你们的不同，他就应当被咒诅。我们已经说了，现在又说，若有人传福音给你们，与你们所领受的不同，他就应当被咒诅。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modernism
现代主义&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job 38:4 “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
Tell me, if you understand.
【伯38:4】 我立大地根基的时候，你在哪里呢？你若有聪明，只管说吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 1:1-2   In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe.
来1:1-2 神既在古时借着众先知，多次多方的晓谕列祖，就在这末世，借着他儿子晓谕我们，又早已立他为承受万有的，也曾借着他创造诸世界。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 17:17   Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.
【约17:17】 求你用真理使他们成圣。你的道就是真理。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 18:37-38a   “You are a king, then!” said Pilate. Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.”  “What is truth?” retorted Pilate. 
约18:37-38上彼拉多就对他说，这样，你是王吗？耶稣回答说，你说我是王。我为此而生，也为此来到世间，特为给真理作见证。凡属真理的人，就听我的话。彼拉多说，真理是什么呢？
4.	Postmodernism
后现代主义&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 15:32   If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”
【林前15:32】 我若当日像寻常人，在以弗所同野兽战斗，那于我有什么益处呢？若死人不复活，我们就吃吃喝喝吧。因为明天要死了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixtures of modernism and postmodernism
现代主义和后现代主义混杂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:35b Scripture cannot be set aside—&lt;br&gt;
约10:35上 经上的话是不能废的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 14:1 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.
【诗14:1】愚顽人心里说，没有神。他们都是邪恶，行了可憎恶的事。没有一个人行善。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 6:19-21   “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.  But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
太6:19-21 不要为自己积攒财宝在地上，地上有虫子咬，能锈坏，也有贼挖窟窿来偷。只要积攒财宝在天上，天上没有虫子咬，不能锈坏，也没有贼挖窟窿来偷。因为你的财宝在哪里，你的心也在哪里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 11:3   But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.
【林前11:3】 我愿意你们知道，基督是各人的头。男人是女人的头，神是基督的头。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:28  There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
【加3:28】 并不分犹太人，希利尼人，自主的，为奴的，或男或女。因为你们在基督耶稣里都成为一了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 15:12, 20   But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?  &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
【林前15:12,20】 既传基督是从死里复活了，怎么在你们中间，有人说没有死人复活的事呢？…… 但基督已经从死里复活，成为睡了之人初熟的果子。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
结语
Any approach to Christian doctrine (saving truth) that does not find truth in the Bible alone is a false approach.  Only one approach is correct:  Scripture alone.
任何建立基督教教义（救恩真理）的方法，只要不是单单根植于圣经，就是错误的方法。只有一种方法是正确的：惟独圣经。&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;PROLEGOMENA
Introduction to the Study of Christian Doctrine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 1 – The Study of Christian Doctrine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 3 ALS bilingual pdf file: Chapter 1 pages 30-48
[NPH: pages 22-34]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lesson 2 we saw that some Christian churches do not base their teachings on the Bible alone.  Some of these churches elevate reason above the Bible.  Others accept traditions as authoritative. 
Traditions change.  Human thinking changes.  In this lesson we want to see that the Bible is unchanging and therefore our faith does not change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 13:7-8 Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus does not change.  His Word also will not change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.	Christianity is the absolute religion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christianity gives us the only way to heaven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	All man-made religions are based on works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 1:20-21; 25  For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.  For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. …They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	Only Christianity teaches salvation by grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 1:16-17 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.  For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christianity is based on the inspired, errorless, unchanging Word of God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	The Word of God (The Bible) does not change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 40:8 The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	 The Bible’s message applies to all people at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.	Theology is an active aptitude to administer the treasures of Scripture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	Those who serve in the public ministry of the church must have this aptitude (ability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Timothy 3:2  Now the overseer is to be…able to teach….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	 Only the Holy Spirit can give this ability to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 2:14  The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 26:17-18 I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.	Christian doctrine is everything that the Bible teaches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	Only the Bible determines Christian doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.	 Reason does not determine what is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 2:9  However, as it is written: “What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived”— the things God has prepared for those who love him— these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.
ii.	 We must teach the truth clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Timothy 1:13-14  What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	 All the Bible is valuable for Christian teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.	Every word is there for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:34-35 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods”’? If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:16 The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii.	The Bible teaches a unified message.  Jesus is the center of its message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 16:17  I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.	 Individual doctrines of the Bible can be distinguished from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 22:29-30 Jesus replied, “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.	The Bible distinguishes between teachings basic to salvation and teachings that assist faith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental doctrines are so basic that we cannot be saved if we deny them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	The doctrine of justification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 5:4 You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	The doctrine of the Triune God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 42:8  “I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 48:16  “Come near me and listen to this: “From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret; at the time it happens, I am there. And now the Sovereign LORD has sent me, endowed with his Spirit.
John 5:23 …that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.
c.	The doctrine of sin and repentance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 2:38   Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d.	The doctrine of the forgiveness of sins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 130:3-4  If you, LORD, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.	The doctrine of the person of Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians 2:8-10a See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ. For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness.
f.	The doctrine of the vicarious atonement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 5:14-15 For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g.	The doctrine of the physical resurrection of Jesus from the dead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 15:12-14 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;h.	The doctrine of the gospel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 14:6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 4:12  Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-fundamental doctrines strengthen or assist our faith but are not essential to salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	The doctrine of angels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 18:10 “See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	The doctrine of verbal inspiration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Timothy 3:15-17  …and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary fundamental doctrines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	Baptism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:5  Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	The Lord’s Supper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 10:21-22  You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons. Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	On what day were the angels created?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job 38:4-7 
“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
Tell me, if you understand.
Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!
Who stretched a measuring line across it?
On what were its footings set,
or who laid its cornerstone—
while the morning stars sang together
and all the angels (literally: sons of God) shouted for joy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	Will the world be annihilated or renewed on the Last Day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 19:28  Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Peter 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.	The academic divisions of theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the text book, God So Loved the World, English page 33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F.	We grow in the study of Christian doctrine through prayer, meditation, and trial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.	Prayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 119:18 
Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.	Meditation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 1:1-2 
Blessed is the one
who does not walk in step with the wicked
or stand in the way that sinners take
or sit in the company of mockers,
but whose delight is in the law of the LORD,
and who meditates on his law day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.	Trial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel 9:1-6  In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes (a Mede by descent), who was made ruler over the Babylonian kingdom— in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the LORD given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years. So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.  I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed “Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.
Conclusion
God’s Word, the Bible, is able to give us a correct and complete understanding of who God is and how he saves us through Jesus Christ, his one and only Son.  The Holy Spirit works through his Word to give us the ability to teach his Word correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distinguish between the ability all Christians have to teach God’s Word and the special abilities give to some to serve in the public ministry.  Col 3:16, 1 Pe 3:15: 2 Co 3:5, 1 Ti 3:2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify the characteristics needed by those who serve in the public ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f.  2 Ti 2:3, 9, 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian doctrine is everything that the Bible teaches.  Pp. 25-27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is true doctrine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain: doctrinal statements may change, but the Bible does not change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any teaching of the Bible with which we can dispense?  Explain.  Mt 28:20, 2 Ti 3:16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a fundamental doctrine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the central doctrine of the Bible? Gal 5:4; Jn 3:18;  Cf.  SA II I:1-5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a non-fundamental doctrine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can an error with regard to a non-fundamental doctrine still undermine the foundation of a person’s faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a “secondary fundamental doctrine?”  Identify which teachings of Scripture fit into this classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a proper use of the term “open question?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is an improper use of the term “open question?”  Mt 28:20&lt;/p&gt;
