        &lt;h2 id=&#34;acts-introduction&#34;&gt;Acts Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The New Testament has a total of _____  books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;26 of the NT books are either ________________  or  ______________.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book of Acts is the ___________________ between these two groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-history-book&#34;&gt;A HISTORY BOOK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts is a ___________________ book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts covers about ______ years of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main characters in the book of Acts &amp;ndash; ______________ (chapters 1-10) and _________________ (chapters 11-28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-book-of-sermons&#34;&gt;A BOOK OF SERMONS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About _________ of the book of Acts is either a sermon or a speech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;author-of-the-book-of-acts&#34;&gt;AUTHOR OF THE BOOK OF ACTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human writer of the book of Acts is not identified by name in Acts or any other book of the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly every Bible scholar believes that it is St. Luke who wrote this book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the opening verses of the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Acts&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Luke   1:1-4  Inasmuch as many have undertaken   to draw up a narrative of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just   as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and servants of the word   handed them down to us, it also seemed best to me after having investigated everything   carefully from the beginning to write it in order for you, most excellent   Theophilus, in order that you may know exactly the certainty of the matters   that you have been taught.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Acts   1:1-2 The earlier written narrative I made, O Theophilus, was of all that   Jesus began both to do and to teach until that day he was taken up after   giving orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles, whom he had chosen.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-we-know-about-luke&#34;&gt;WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT LUKE?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke is mentioned only ______ times in the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke is the only _______________  writer of a book of the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The books of Luke and Acts are two of the longest books of the New Testament. In fact, his writings total about _________ of the New Testament, or _______of the entire Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke was not one of the _____________________, or even an eyewitness or immediate disciple of the Lord (Luke states that he had carried out extensive research and had written an orderly account about Jesus &amp;ndash; Luke 1:1-4.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke was _________________ (Colossians 4:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His city of origin is ______________________ .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was a companion and co-worker of  ____________________ (2 Timothy 4:11; Acts  16:10–17; 20:5–15; 21:1–18; 27:1–28:16.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-we-know-about-theophilus&#34;&gt;WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEOPHILUS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book of Acts is dedicated to a man named ___________________.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a Greek or Gentile name that means __________________________.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is called _________________________which indicates that he may have been a high-ranking Roman official of some sort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-purpose-of-the-book-of-acts&#34;&gt;THE PURPOSE OF THE BOOK OF ACTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose seems to be two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a)	To present the history of the early Christian church (for Theophilus and all of us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b)	To show how the great commission of Jesus (“preach the Gospel to all the world”) was carried out under the power of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-was-acts-written&#34;&gt;WHEN WAS ACTS WRITTEN?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book of Acts must have been written after the _______________________ was written, according to the introduction of Acts (Acts 1:1-3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was probably also written prior to ______________ terrible persecution of Christians (which began in AD 64), the death of St. Paul (about AD 64) and the destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70), since Luke mentions neither of these significant events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could date the book at about AD ______________.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-structure-of-the-book&#34;&gt;THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three easy ways to outline the book of Acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;athe-two-key-figures&#34;&gt;a)	The Two Key Figures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a.	Peter’s Ministry = Acts 1 to Acts 12:24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b.	Paul’s Ministry = Acts 12:25 to Acts 28:31&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bsix-growth-points&#34;&gt;b)	Six growth points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a.	Acts 6:7: And the word of God kept growing, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem continued to multiply very much, and a large number of the priests began to obey the faith. (This notes the preaching and the growth of the church in Jerusalem.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b.	Acts 9:31 Therefore the church throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria was having peace, was being built up and proceeding in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, and was being multiplied in numbers. (This notes the preaching and the growth of the church throughout Judea and Samaria.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c.	Acts 12:24 But the word of God kept growing and was being multiplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d.	Acts 16:5 Therefore the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.	Acts 19:20 In this manner the word of the Lord kept growing mightily and was wielding power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;f.	Acts 28:31 preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, without hindrance. (These last verses note that the preaching of the word had by Paul reached the ends of the earth, to Rome, the capital of the Gentile world in Europe.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cjesus-commission-and-mission-strategy-stated-in-acts-18-you-will-be-my-witnesses-both-in-jerusalem-and-in-all-judea-and-samaria-and-even-as-far-as-the-end-of-the-earth&#34;&gt;c)	Jesus’ commission and mission strategy stated in Acts 1:8: “You will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even as far as the end of the earth.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a.	 Part 1: Jesus’ witnesses spread his gospel in Jerusalem, the capital of the Jews, Acts 1:1-6:7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b.	Part 2: Jesus’ witnesses spread his gospel throughout Judea and Samaria, Acts 6:8-12:24.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c.	Part 3: Jesus’ witnesses carry his gospel to the ends of the earth, to Rome, the capital of the Gentiles, Acts 12:25-28-31.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;F.	Acts 5:17-6:7 The apostles are arrested and the church elects its first deacons&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE APOSTLES OF JESUS CHRIST
The original 12 apostles were named in Luke 6:14-16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simon (whom he named Peter),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew (the brother of Simon Peter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James (son of Zebedee)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John (brother of James)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bartholomew (Nathanael)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew (the tax collector also known as Levi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas (nicknamed Didymus “the twin”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James son of Alphaeus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simon who was called the Zealot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judas son of James (Thaddaeus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
In addition to these 12, there were several others:
•	Acts 1:26  __________________________
•	1 Corinthians 15:8-9  _______________________________
•	Acts 14:14 _______________________________
•	Romans 16:7  _______________________________&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHAT IS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY?
Apostolic authority is the special authority given by Jesus Himself to those He had chosen to be His apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostolic Authority is ____________________________________________________
•	Mark 3:13–15; John 20:21; 2 Corinthians 5:20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostolic Authority is ____________________________________________________

&lt;p&gt;Apostolic Authority includes ____________________________________________________
•	Mark 6:7; Luke 9:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostolic Authority includes ____________________________________________________
•	Mark 16:2; Acts 5:12; 2 Corinthians 12:12;&lt;/p&gt;

•	1 Corinthians 9:11–14; 1 Corinthians 9:4; 2 Corinthians 11:7–9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO HAS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY?
The apostle Paul regarded apostolic authority as absolutely critical to his ministry. See how he begins most of his epistles by referring to it:
•	Romans 1:1; 2 Corinthians 1:1; Galatians 1:1; Ephesians 1:1; Colossians 1:1 ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are going to be false teachers and fake apostles. The Lord warned about those who coveted this authority, and its powers. Here are two verses that refer to such imposters:
•	2 Corinthians 11:13; Revelation 2:2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two indications that someone has apostolic authority are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUSTIFICATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read John 1:29. Whose sins did the Lamb of God take away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read 1 John 2:1-2. For whose sins is Jesus the atoning sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Romans 5:12-19, especially vv.l8-l9. Paul is com¬paring the work of two men here? Who are these two men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was Adam’s deed? (v.18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people were affected by it? (v.18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How were these people affected by it? (v.18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was Christ’s deed? (v.18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people were affected by it? (v.18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How were these people affected by it? (v.16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put all of these things together in the blanks of this chart:
The Doer: 		
The Deed: 		
The Recipients:		
The Result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read 1 Timothy 2:6. For whom did Christ give himself as a ransom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Romans 8:32. For whom did God deliver up his own Son?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read 2 Corinthians 5:11-19. For whom did Jesus die? (v.14-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean when v.19 says that God “reconciled” the world to Himself? (v.19 gives the answer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To “reconcile” means “to not count men’s sins against them.” This is exactly the same as “to justify.” Who has God reconciled (justified) according to v.19?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Romans 3:3. Does man’s reaction to the Gospel change what God has done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY
•	Objective justification is universal, for all people of all times and places.
•	It was accomplished at one historical point in time, namely when Christ was crucified and rose again from the dead.
•	It is independent of man’s reaction to it.
•	It is totally complete and requires no additions ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Mark 16:15-16. What is the “good news?” To whom is it to be preached? Who will be saved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Hebrews 4:2. Who heard the Gospel but did not benefit from it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read John 1:12. What part does faith play in justification according to this verse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Galatians 2:16. How is a person justified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Romans 5:1 and Romans 3:28. How is a person justified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY
•	Faith is not a cause of justification, nor a condition which must be fulfilled for justification. Faith is that which receives the reconciliation pro¬claimed in the Gospel.
•	Subjective justification is also referred to as “personal justification.”
•	Subjective justification is an on-going act, taking place whenever a sinner comes to faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONE AND ONLY SON THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH BUT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.”&lt;/p&gt;

•	“Why did God allow James to die, but not Peter?”

&lt;p&gt;HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHAT IS RIGHTEOUSNESS?
The word “righteous” or “righteousness” occurs _____  times in the NIV (1984). 
Righteousness is ____________________ to all of God’s laws:
•	Deuteronomy 6:25 
Righteousness is equated with _______________________________________:
•	Job 4:17
•	Job 22:3 
The righteous person is the opposite of the __________________________:
•	Psalm 1:6 
Righteousness is the opposite of ________:
•	Proverbs 14:34&lt;br&gt;
The righteous are said to be ___________________________________________: 
•	Psalm 1:5
•	Proverbs 20:7 
•	Ezekiel 18:5–9
Those who _________________________________ are declared righteous:
•	Romans 2:13 
Conclusion:
•	Righteousness is the same as ___________________________________. It is ______________________ all that God says, and living in accord with God’s will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHY DO WE NEED IT?
The Lord __________________________ righteousness:
•	1 Samuel 26:23
The Lord _____________________________the righteous people, hears their prayers and delivers them from trouble:
•	Psalm 34:15
•	Psalm 34:17 
•	Psalm 34:19 
Righteousness __________________________ from death:
•	Proverbs 10:2 
•	Proverbs 11:19
•	Proverbs 12:28 
•	Romans 10:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO HAS RIGHTEOUSNESS?
___________________  has righteousness
•	Psalm 143:2 
•	Ecclesiastes 7:20 
•	Romans 3:10 
Some people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW DO WE ACQUIRE IT?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not through the ______________:
•	Romans 3:20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ___________________________ righteousness:
•	Isaiah 61:10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through _______________________________:
•	Romans 3:21–22 
•	Romans 1:17 
•	Romans 4:23–24 
•	Romans 10:3–4 
•	Philippians 3:7–9 
•	Romans 4:1–16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUTHER’S TOWER EXPERIENCE
•	Romans 1:17
•	“I did not love, yes, I hated the righteous God who punishes sinners. Is it not enough, that God crushes us miserable sinners with His law, that He has to threaten us with punishment through the Gospel, too?”
•	His righteousness as a gift in Christ, he felt that he “was altogether born again and had entered paradise itself through open gates . . . that place in Paul was for me truly the gate to paradise.” 
•	“I extolled my sweetest word with a love as great as the hatred with which I had before hated the word `righteousness of God.&amp;rsquo; Thus that place in Paul was for me truly the gate to paradise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JESUS IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS
•	Jeremiah 23:5–6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord Jesus, You are my righteousness,
I am your sin.
You became what you were not,
that I might become what I was not. Amen.
– Martin Luther&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE ANTICHRIST
•	Read 1 John 2:18-23 
•	What does John say about many of the antichrists that appeared in his day? (1 John 2:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	Look again at 1 John 2:22-23. What is the main lie of the antichrist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	How have many done this, even in our own day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	Read 1 John 4:1-3.
•	Read 2 John 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of THE ANTICHRIST is revealed in four main New Testament passages:
•	1 John 2:8-29
•	1 John 4:1-3
•	2 John 7
•	2 Thessalonians 2:1-12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MARKS OR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANTICHRIST
Read 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12. 
Five distinctive marks of the Antichrist are given. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v. 3 =&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v. 4 =&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v. 4 =&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v. 9 =&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v. 8 = 
THE THREE PERIODS IN THE HISTORY OF THE ANTICHRIST
In verse 5-12 St. Paul sketches three periods in the history of the Antichrist.  What are they?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.8a,9,10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.8b) 
WHO IS THE ANTICHRIST?
To confessional Lutherans it seems obvious that there is only one phenomenon in the history of the Church that has all the marks of the Antichrist given in Paul’s prophecy. That is the Roman papacy. In the 16th century Luther and all the other reformers were convinced that the Roman papacy was the very Antichrist. They confessed their convictions in the Smalcald Articles of 1537:
The pope is the very antichrist, who has exalted himself above, and opposed himself against Christ, because he will not permit Christians to be saved without his power.  - Smalcald Articles, part 2, Article 4, #10.
Melanchthon, too, in his tract on The Power and Primacy of The Pope singled out the Roman pontiff as the very Antichrist, “The Marks of Antichrist plainly agree with the kingdom of the Pope and his adherents” (Smalcald Articles 514.39).
Why were these Lutherans so convinced of this identification? Here is why:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antichrist sits in the temple of God.
The antichrist will thus be found within the Christian Church, in the temple of God. He is a liar and deceiver working within Christianity itself. 
The Roman Catholic church can still be called Christian. It still maintains many Christian doctrines, such as the Trinity, the efficacy of baptism, the inerrancy and inspiration of the Bible, and the real presence in the Lord’s Supper.  There are still pious Christians in Roman Catholicism, who, solely by the grace of God, have come to trust in Christ as their Savior. The Roman papacy would seem to fill this mark of the antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antichrist assumes the power and authority of God.
The word of God teaches that the antichrist claims for himself prerogatives, power, and authority that only belong to God:  “He opposes and exalts himself over everything that is called God or is worshipped&amp;hellip; proclaiming himself to be God” (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).
Only God has the power to determine what is right and what is wrong. God alone can say what is sin and what is not. Only God has the power and authority to determine what is to be believed and taught in His Church. However, the antichrist opposes God and, exalting himself, claims for himself the authority and supremacy of God. The antichrist claims to be the head of the Christian Church, while, in reality, Christ is the Church’s only Head. Christ alone rules and directs His Church (see Matthew 28:18-20; Romans 14:8-9; Eph. 1:20-23; Phil.2:9-11; 1 Tim. 5:15; Heb. 2:7-8). Christ alone establishes the Church’s doctrine.
At Luther’s time the papacy opposed Christ’s teaching and authority and claimed supremacy for itself. In the papal decree Unam Sanctam, issued November 18, 1302, the papacy declared:
“We are compelled to believe and hold the one Holy Catholic and itself apostolic church with urgent faith&amp;hellip;. outside of which there is neither salvation nor remission of sins&amp;hellip; moreover that every human creature is to be subject to the Roman pontiff, we declare, we say, we define, and we pronounce, to be altogether necessary for salvation.”
In 1870 the first Vatican Council approved this decree under the direction of the pope:
“And so, if anyone says that the Roman Pontiff has only the office of inspection or direction, but not the full supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole church, not only in matters that pertain to faith and morals, but also in matters that pertain to the discipline and government of the church throughout the whole world, or if anyone says that he has only a more important part and not the complete fullness of this supreme power; or if anyone says that this power is not ordinary and immediate over each and every church or over each and every one of the pastors and the faithful, let him be damned.”
At Vatican II (1962-1965) in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, the papacy declared: 
“But the college or body of Bishops has no authority unless it is simultaneously conceived of in terms of its head, the Roman Pontiff, Peter’s successor, and without any lessening of his power of primacy over all, pastors as well as the general faithful. For in virtue of his office, that is, as vicar of Christ and pastor of the whole Christian Church, the Roman Pontiff has full, supreme, and universal power over the church, and he can always exercise this freely.”
The pope claims infallibility for himself in matters of doctrine. In the decrees of the Vatican I, the papacy declares:
“We teach and define that it is a dogma divinely revealed that the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when, in discharge of the office of pastor or teacher of all Christians, by virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine regarding faith or morals to be held by the universal church, is, by the divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, possessed of that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer willed that his church should be endowed in defining doctrine regarding faith or morals, and that therefore, such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of themselves, and not from the consent of the church, irreformable.”
With this unconscionable demand the Roman pontiff was in fact “proclaiming himself to be God”, as St. Paul had foretold. He enforced his outrageous claim by imposing excommunication or the interdict on those who dared to impose him. In 1077 Henry IV, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, stood for three days outside the pope&amp;rsquo;s residence at Canossa, barefoot and bareheaded in the bitter January cold, begging the forgiveness of Gregory VII whose authority he had defied. The pope claimed that he alone, as the vicar of Christ and successor of Peter, possessed the keys to the kingdom of heaven. This was his key to power. With this weapon he tyrannized men&amp;rsquo;s consciences and set himself up in God’s temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterfeit signs and wonders
The Antichrist will deceive many with counterfeit miracles and wonders. We know about healings at shrines, graves, images of saints, and other miracles that are part of the Catholic world. That is satanic fraud, or if supernatural things do occur, they are done by satanic powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposed to God and The Saving Truth.
Paul speaks about a final mark of the antichrist. Paul says that the antichrist is the man of sin who epitomizes the rebellion against revealed truth of the Gospel. Paul also says that the antichrist opposes God by powerfully, craftily and boldly teaching lies.  These Satanic lies of the antichrist are in direct opposition to the will of God that all men be saved through faith in Jesus Christ. Antichrist’s satanic lie is that a sinner is not saved by grace alone. Thus the antichrist opposes God’s doctrine of justification by grace alone through faith alone in the atoning work of Christ. The papacy has declared:
“If anyone says that the sinner is justified by faith alone, meaning that nothing else is required to cooperate in order to obtain the grace of justification, and that it is not in any way necessary that he be prepared and disposed by the action of his own will, let him be damned. If anyone says that Justifying faith is nothing else than confidence in divine mercy, which remits sins for Christ&amp;rsquo;s sake, or that it is this confidence alone that justifies us, let him be damned.”
This statement is in direct opposition to the clear statement of God: “You are saved by grace through faith, and this is not of your own doing, it is the gift of God, not of works, so no one can boast” (Eph. 2:8-9). This position of the papacy has not changed one iota in the years since the Council of Trent declared it. Vatican I &amp;amp; II declared this statement to be infallible and irreformable.
The devil’s doctrine of work-righteousness had reared its ugly head already in the days of the apostles. Repeatedly Paul wielded the sword of the Spirit against it in his letters to the churches. It is an error that inheres in the sinful heart of man by nature. 
Is the papacy the very antichrist mentioned in Scripture? As little as one can prove the doctrine of the incarnation or the doctrine of the resurrection of Christ to the satisfaction of human reason, so little can one prove the doctrine that the papacy is the antichrist. But those who treasure the doctrine of justification will also with the eyes of faith recognize the arch-antagonist of this doctrine as the antichrist.
The marks of the antichrist were given to the church in order that a positive identification of the antichrist may be made. Only the papacy fulfills those marks. What other antichristian force except the papacy can claim all at the same time to have existed as one human being for hundreds of years, rule in the midst of believers, replace the word of God, deny that Jesus is the Christ, and cause the greatest falling away from the Christian faith ever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHURCH DISCIPLINE
WHAT IS “CHURCH DISCIPLINE”?
Read Luke 17:3 
If a fellow Christian sins, we are to ___________________________________.
If a sinner repents, we are to ____________________________________.
Read Proverbs 13:24 and Revelation 3:19 
God wants us to associate discipline with ________________ 
Notes:
•	“Discipline” = “to educate, to teach” (The word “discipline” comes from the same word as “disciple” = someone who follows and learns)
•	The terminology “church discipline” may be used in a broad or narrow sense. 
•	Broad sense: The entire process of admonition, from private admonition to the final stages of public admonition of the entire church, as outlined in Matthew 18:15-18.
•	Narrow sense: The final stages of admonition when the process of personal and private brotherly admonition moves to the stages where the entire congregation is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OR GOAL OF CHURCH DISCIPLINE?
Read Galatians 6:1-2
The purpose and goal of all church discipline is to _______________________________
Read Romans 12:17-19 
The purpose or goal of discipline is never to: ___________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:
•	The purpose of church discipline is to teach a person in a loving way the grave consequences of unrepentant sin. Impenitence, since it leads to loss of faith and eternal damnation, is something that a concerned group of Christians will care about. Thus, church discipline is not about punishment, but Christian love.
•	Embarrassing or humiliating the sinner have no place in proper church discipline, nor do revenge or punishment.
•	Proper church discipline is not done to “clean up the membership role” but to help the sinner. 
•	Rumor and hear-say is not sufficient evidence to pursue church discipline. We must rebuke sin only when there is clear evidence of it. 
•	Mass excommunications of groups or large numbers of people, even if the sin is the same (such as neglect of the means of grace) is never proper. Each individual case is special and unique.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHURCH DISCIPLINE?
Read Colossians 3:16  What are Christians to do for each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read James 5:19-20  What are Christians to do for each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Leviticus 19:17  What are Christians to do for each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes: 
•	Brotherly admonition is a duty which all Christians owe one another. 
•	It consists of speaking to a fellow Christian about his sin, urging him to repent of it and forsake it. 
•	This is not the duty of the pastor alone, or of the church council alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW IS CHURCH DISCIPLINE CARRIED OUT? 
Read Matthew 18:15-17 
What are the four steps or stages of church discipline as outlined by Jesus in these verses?
v.15	__________________________________________________________________
v. 16  __________________________________________________________________
v. 17a __________________________________________________________________
v. 17b __________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes on the first three stages of church discipline.
Stage One: Private Admonition
•	This stage may be carried out by any and every Christian, including the pastor.
•	The private admonition should rarely be limited to a single contact.
•	Patient and humble instruction, with a careful use of the Word of God, is used during private admonition. The facts need to be carefully substantiated during this stage. 
Stage Two: Discipline with One or Two Witnesses
•	When a Christian needs to involve one or two witnesses, the concerned Christian will invite one or two others to accompany him or her on the visit, but will not tell the witnesses about the situation ahead of time. The witnesses need to be neutral and unprejudiced so that they can testify to the truth with integrity.
•	As in stage one, a number of contacts are usually made in making every attempt to avoid taking the case beyond this stage.
Stage Three: Taking It To The Church
•	As in stage two, when the discipline matter comes to this stage, the church should only be told in the presence of the one who is under discipline so that he or she can defend him/herself and answer to the charges of sin and impenitence. Every effort needs to be made to have the person who is under discipline present in person at the meeting at which the case is brought forward.
•	Once again, repeated contacts are often appropriate during this stage of discipline as every effort is made to regain the sinner.
•	“The Church” is understood to mean the local congregation. This stage can take place in a properly called meeting of the congregation, or its representatives (such as a voters assembly).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;OPENING PRAYER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PREDESTINATION
WHERE IS PREDESTINATION FOUND IN THE BIBLE?
Matthew 24:22, 24, 31
2 Peter 1:10
Romans 8:29-30
Romans chapters 9-11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPHESIANS 1:3-14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did God choose us (predestine us) to be His people? (see v. 4 and also 2 Thessalonians 2:13 and 2 Timothy 1:9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caused God to choose us? (see vs 5-6 and 2 Timothy 1:8-9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 5 it says that our predestination was “in accordance with his pleasure and will.” What is God’s “pleasure and will?” 
•	Matthew 11:25-26 =&lt;br&gt;
•	John 6:40 =&lt;br&gt;
•	Ezekiel 33:11 =&lt;br&gt;
•	1 Timothy 2:3-4 =&lt;br&gt;
•	2 Peter 3:9 =&lt;br&gt;
•	Romans 9:18 =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How shall we react to the teaching that God has chosen us to be His own before the creation of the world? (v. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are we to classify our knowledge of our election? (v. 3b)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did God predestine us? (v. 4c)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far Paul has described God choosing us before the creation of the world as a blessing which God bestowed in grace and love. Therefore, what conclusion shall we make about our election?
a. God knew ahead of time that we would be better than the rest?
b. God knew ahead of time that He would make us better than the rest?
c. God knew ahead of time that we’d be smart enough to believe?
d. That God’s grace did everything to save us, beginning with our election?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In v. 9 Paul writes that this subject of God’s plan to choose us is “a mystery.” Some people don’t want there to be anything mysterious about God or His purposes. It annoys them because they want their religion to be logical and explainable. But God is God, and His ways and thoughts are higher than our thoughts. After pondering God’s mysterious election, Paul wrote: “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! “Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?”” (Romans 11:33–34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vs 12-13 Paul makes the contrast between two groups of people. Who are the “we” and who are the “you”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You also were included in Christ&amp;hellip;” (v. 13) What did that mean for the Christians in Ephesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You were marked in him (Christ) with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit.” (1:13) What is Paul describing here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In v. 14 Paul writes that the Holy Spirit is “a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance.” Another term for “deposit” is “down payment.” How does this remove any doubts that God loves us and want us to be His own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAITH AND GOOD WORKS
“Good works are injurious to salvation IF we depend on them for our salvation.” – Dr. Martin Luther&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES AND PAUL
Look at the chart below and read the cited portions of James’ letter and Paul’s letter to the Romans. Is James in conflict with Paul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;JAMES 2:20-24 (NIV)	
ROMANS 4:1-5 (NIV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless? 21 Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 22 You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 23 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called God&amp;rsquo;s friend. 24 You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone. 	
What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter? 2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about    but not before God. 3 What does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” 4 Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation. 5 However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is right? Paul or James?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what point in his life was Abraham considered “righteous” before God?
A) When he believed God’s promises. (Genesis 15:1-6)
B) When he was willing to offer his son, Isaac. (Genesis 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is James saying here about Abraham?
a)	Because Abraham was willing to offer Isaac, God justified him.
b)	Because Abraham was willing to offer up Isaac, he showed that he had justifying faith.
c)	Abraham’s willingness to offer Isaac showed that justifying faith does good works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is James saying in verse 24?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are saved by faith and good works, not faith alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are saved by good works alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are saved by faith alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faith alone is not saving faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving faith is never without good works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAITHWORKS
Now let’s read James 2:14–18 (NIV84): 
“What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? 15 Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. 16 If one of you says to him, “Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? 17 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. 18 But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAITH: “Can faith save him?”
•	Of course. Didn’t Jesus say to the sinful woman who anointed him with oil, “Your faith has saved you.” Didn’t Peter and John say to the jailor at Philippi, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved?”
•	Didn’t Luther say, “Faith alone?” And hasn’t the pastor told us most every Sunday that we cannot save ourselves, no matter how many works we do, but salvation is through faith in Jesus – and only that?
•	Can faith save us? Absolutely. In fact there is no other way to be saved from our sin except through faith in Jesus and what he did on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WORKS: “Salvation by faith alone, but faith is never alone.”
•	What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? “what good is it?” – no good, its worthless.
•	“You people are so heavenly minded that you are no earthly good.”  We emphasize that salvation is by faith – and rightly so – but if we simply use that as an excuse to go about our lives without being involved in helping others and working for the good of all, then what good is our faith? 
•	Galatians 5:6 says, “The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.” 
•	1 Corinthians 13:2 says: “If I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.”
•	Faith needs to express itself. If it is alive, it will be doing things. It will be functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAITHWORKS. 
The two words are together. That’s because faith in Christ and good works cannot be separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT HAPPENS AFTER ACTS ENDS?
The book of Acts seems to end strangely. According to the last verses of Acts, Paul lived under house arrest in a rented house somewhere in Rome for two years (Acts 28:30). Then what happened? Was Paul released? Was he brought to trial before the emperor, convicted and martyred? We are not told. It seems like a strange way for Luke to end his historical record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AD 62 – IMPRISONED IN ROME
•	two-year house arrest in Rome
•	“bound with a chain” (Acts 28:20).

&lt;p&gt;THE BOOK OF HEBREWS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AN UNUSUAL BOOK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPISTLE OR A DEVOTION?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews	Epistles
“In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.” (Hebrews 1:1-3)
Romans 1:1 – “Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle…”
James 1:1 – “James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations …”
1 Peter 1:1 – “Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God’s elect … grace and peace be yours in abundance.”
2 John – “The elder, to the chosen lady and her children … grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WORD OF EXHORTATION
“a word of exhortation” (Hebrews 13:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE HUMAN AUTHOR

•	Hebrews 13:23 he calls Timothy “our brother Timothy”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibilities:

&lt;p&gt;THE RECIPIENTS
•	Christians known to the writer (13:19) 
•	They had been in the faith for some time (5:12)
•	They had previously suffered persecution (10:32-34)
•	They also seemed to be Jewish in background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE DATE
No later than: _________________	Possibly: _____________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE PURPOSE AND THEME
Read these two passages: Hebrews 12:4,12 and Hebrews 2:1
What was the purpose of the book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now read Hebrews 12:14 
What was another purpose of the book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main part of the book, the writer proclaims this theme: “Christ Is Superior.”
•	1:1-3 	Christ is superior to the prophets
•	1:4-2:18 	Christ is superior to the angels
•	3:1-4:13 	Christ is superior to Moses
•	4:14-7:28 	Christ is superior to all the High Priests
•	8:1-10:18 	Christ is superior to the old covenant, sanctuary, and sacrifices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNINGS
Hebrews includes 6 important warnings. Let’s read them:
•	Warning #1 = 2:1-4
•	Warning #2 = 3:7-4:2
•	Warning #3 = 5:11-6:8
•	Warning #4 = 10:26-31
•	Warning #5 = 12:14-17
•	Warning #6 = 12:25-29&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last portion of the book, the writer makes applications to the Christian’s life. He encourages them to show their faith by godly living.&lt;br&gt;
•	10:19-12:29 	Applications to believer’s life
•	13:1-25 	Concluding exhortations&lt;/p&gt;
