<p><strong>WHICH EXERTS CONTROL OVER US</strong></p>
<p>Romans 8:1&ndash;17</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is Paul&rsquo;s teaching about the sinful nature and the new inner being
in the believer confirmed in your own life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROMANS 8: 1 &ndash; 8</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul said in chapter 7 that living the Christian life will not be
easy. We have a sinful nature that is constantly with us and
frequently leading us into sin. It is an ongoing battle. Now, he
emphasized the Spirit and its mighty influence in the believer&rsquo;s life.
Anyone who is in Christ Jesus, think of it as in the sphere of Christ
Jesus, there is no condemnation. There isn&rsquo;t a single judgment that
can be raised against a believer. The reason, &ldquo;because&rdquo; (vs 2), is
Jesus set me free from the control of sin and death. Sin and its
condemnation resulting in eternal separation from God is gone. The law
itself could never accomplish this. It couldn&rsquo;t produce a single
acquittal before God. The law was powerless to do that, not because of
a problem with the law, but the sinful nature only rebelled against
God&rsquo;s will. God went into action and solved the problem. Here is a
listing of what God did:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sent his own Son - Jesus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sent him in human likeness &ndash; had a true humanity and real flesh and
blood. Phil 2:7 &ldquo;human likeness&rdquo; however he had no sin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be a sin offering &ndash; he offered himself as the sacrifice for the
sin of the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>condemned sin &ndash; instead of sin condemning us, Sin was condemned, it
was paid for, it couldn&rsquo;t threaten us with eternal judgment anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>righteous requirements of the law &ndash; Jesus lived a life that fully
and perfectly kept the law. His perfection is credited to believers
and is now &ldquo;in us&rdquo; (4).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The sinful nature of an unbeliever prompts a mindset, a way of
thinking, that only reflects who they are. There whole being and
existence conforms to the sinful nature. There whole thought process
flows from the sinful nature. The contrast is equally true for the
person who believes and thus has received the Holy Spirit. According
to their new man, in the new way of the Spirit (7:6) the believers
thought process flows from that Spirit.</p>
<p>Those controlled by the sinful nature are only hostile to God, they
can&rsquo;t submit to God&rsquo;s will and can&rsquo;t do anything pleasing to God. In
the next verses Paul develops the thought of the Spirit&rsquo;s influence on
believers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. What Christ accomplished blessings does Paul celebrate in vs. 1-2?</p>
<p>2. How did God remove the sin that the Law exposed and condemned but
we could not get rid of? (3-4)</p>
<p>3. What is the spiritual condition of those controlled by the sinful
nature? (5-8)</p>
<p>4. By contrast, what is the spiritual condition of those who are
controlled by the spiritual nature? (5-6)</p>
<p>5. Why can&rsquo;t those controlled by the sinful nature please God? (8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROMANS 8: 9 &ndash; 17</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is impossible to be a believer and not have the Holy Spirit. The
Holy Spirit creates faith and so whenever the Holy Spirit is in a
person, there faith has already been created by the Spirit and he is
present. Paul said the Spirit of God lives in you &ndash; ongoing action.
It isn&rsquo;t that the Spirit created faith and then moves on to another
person and we are left on our own. The Spirit of God lives in every
believer. Although the Spirit lives in us, our body is still destined
to die (10), but our spiritual nature is alive. It is alive &ldquo;because
of righteousness.&rdquo; (10) The word translated righteousness has two
basic meanings, (1) being declared not guilty before God because of
Jesus, acquitted of all wrong before God (2) doing what is right in
God&rsquo;s eyes. Both options would fit here, but the second fits the
context better. Our spiritual nature under the control of the Holy
Spirit is guiding us to do what is right before God. This isn&rsquo;t
earning our forgiveness but it is the evidence that the Holy Spirit
has created faith in us. Even though our bodies are destined to die,
they will be raised to eternal life.</p>
<p>Through Christ and the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work we are the sons of God. The
term sons of God refers to both male and females, through Christ we
are the children of God. We have been adopted into God&rsquo;s family and
can call the Almighty God our Father. The Holy Spirit testifies and
our spiritual nature also testifies that we are God&rsquo;s children and
thus heirs of eternal life. What gracious blessings the Spirit brings
to us in Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KEYWORD &ndash; SONS OF GOD</strong>- A term that includes every believer, male or
female, ethnic group or occupation in a society (Galatians 3:26-28)</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>6. Comment &ldquo;You cannot have spiritual life with God without God the
Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7. What are some of the blessings the Holy Spirit brings to us?</p>
<p>1) vs 9</p>
<p>2) vs 10</p>
<p>3) vs 11</p>
<p>4) vs 13</p>
<p>5) vs 14</p>
<p>6) vs 15</p>
<p>7) vs 17</p>
<p>8. Paul said, &ldquo;by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the
body&rdquo; (13). &ldquo;Put to death&rdquo; is present tense. What does that mean about
our daily lives?</p>
<p>9. How do we put to death the misdeeds of the body? How does that
relate to what Paul said about himself in chapter 7:14-20?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[PREPARING FOR NEXT WEEK&rsquo;S CLASS]{.ul}</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read Romans 8:18 &ndash; 39</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read Romans &ndash; the People&rsquo;s Bible Pages 133 - 145</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read Romans 8:18 &ndash; 39 a second time but this time out loud.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we aren&rsquo;t slaves to fear in Christ (15) what kind of attitudes and
confidence can we have in Christ?</p>
