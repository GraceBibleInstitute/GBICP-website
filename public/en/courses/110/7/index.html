	<p><strong>GOD GIVES US PEACE AND A NEW LIFE THROUGH JESUS</strong></p>
<p>Romans 5:1 &ndash;21</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does our faith get strengthen in God&rsquo;s promises as Abraham&rsquo;s was
strengthened? Vs. 20</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROMANS 5:1-2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul begins with the word, &ldquo;therefore.&rdquo; That points us back to
probably all of Romans 3:21-4:21. The whole world was declared not
guilty, acquitted before God, of any wrongdoing because of the blood
of Jesus. We personally received the benefit of that fact through
trusting what God had said (not guilty). A result is peace. There is
no peace for the wicked (Is. 48:22). Humans try to run away from God
because of guilt. For the believer in Jesus we live in peace. The idea
of the word translated &ldquo;gained access&rdquo; is getting into a restricted
place to meet someone of great importance. We have gained access into
God&rsquo;s room of grace. We don&rsquo;t just visit it on occasion, we live in
it! He also says that we rejoice in hope. Hope always points to the
future &ndash; we don&rsquo;t have it now but we are totally confident we will be
in the glory of God in the future. We rejoice in that hope. We can&rsquo;t
stop talking about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What blessings does Paul list because we are justified through faith
in Jesus?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the picture of always standing (living) in God&rsquo;s room of
grace impact how we perceive our life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is wrong with this comment made by a believer, &ldquo;I hope I am not
sinning when I die&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Their understanding of sin in their life &ndash;</p>
<p>Their understanding of God&rsquo;s grace &ndash;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Why can we be so confident in our Christian hope?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 5: 3-5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Believers have an amazing hope for the future that nothing can
diminish or destroy. We praise God for this hope. Hope always points
to the future, a future that we have through Christ Jesus. Now Paul
says we can also praise God for our sufferings. The word suffering
means literally to be pressed down. Situations can press down on us or
squeeze us. During those pressing situations, we can know (ongoing,
clear understanding) that suffering can result in perseverance. A
patience, a determination to continue on because we know that a loving
God is watching over us. This joy that we have in sufferings is not a
simple strong resolve nor is it finding some strange pleasure in
misery but an awareness that God has a divine plan and purpose in
Christ.</p>
<p>This joy in sufferings produces character. The word has the idea of
acquiring good traits as a result of a test. God is developing good
traits in us through these difficulties. Paul then brings us back to
our hope. God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy
Spirit. A love already demonstrated by sending Jesus to be our Savior.
The hope that we have because of Jesus will never disappoint us or be
some kind of illusion. On Judgment Day our hope will be fulfilled and
proved true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Why are Christians able to rejoice in suffering?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can God use suffering to develop our Christian character?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 5:6 &ndash; 11</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The coming of Jesus wasn&rsquo;t random nor was it prompted by humanity, it
was the right time set by God. When he came we were powerless, ungodly
and sinners. Humanity, individually or collectively, could offer no
valid reason why Jesus should come and redeem us. The sacrifice of the
blood of Jesus is an amazing act of love. There is no comparison to
any human act of love. Notice it says, &ldquo;God demonstrates his own love
for us.&rdquo; Everyday his love is demonstrated to us in Christ. Verses 9
and 10 use two different words to communicate what Jesus has done for
us, justified and reconciled. The word justified puts it in a legal
context, we are acquitted of all wrongdoing before God. Reconciled
puts it in a personal context, we are no longer enemies of God but
friends with him through Christ. As forgiven children of God we have a
joy in life. A joy in the Lord himself. A joy in God and what he has
done for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KEWORD: RECONCILED</strong> &ndash; No longer an enemy but a friend</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>How does Paul stress that Jesus&rsquo; sacrifice was one of undeserved and
unexpected love for us and others in vs. 6-8?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you say to a person who claims that Jesus died for us
because people were worth saving?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over what things does the God who justified sinners teach us to
rejoice in this section? (vs1-11)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 5: 12 - 17</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adam&rsquo;s one sin impacted every one of his descendants. Adam lost the
image of God with his sin and now had a sinful nature. That sinful
nature was present in every person that followed him. All future
people would be sinners. With sin entering the human race death also
came, the wages of sin. Think of death as the idea of separation.
Physical death result from sin &ndash; separating of the soul from the
body. Spiritual death occurred with Adam&rsquo;s sin &ndash; separating of people
from a relationship with God. Eternal death occurred as people were
eternally separated from God. Death of all kinds entered the world
through Adam&rsquo;s one sin.</p>
<p>Jesus brings life to this wretched human situation. Think of life as
connecting. Physical life means body and soul are connected, spiritual
life means a person is connected to God in a relationship, eternal
life means that connected relationship with God extends into eternity.
Jesus provides the answer to our human need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>What terrible things did Adam bring into the world? (12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theologians have called the sin described in vs 12 as &ldquo;original sin&rdquo;
or &ldquo;inherited sin&rdquo;. What do these terms explain about sin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are &ldquo;the many&rdquo; of vs. 19?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 5:18 &ndash; 21</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Verse 18 expresses again what has been said many times before by Paul.
The result of Adam&rsquo;s sin was the condemnation of all people throughout
the world. The result of Christ&rsquo;s action is the declaration by God
that all the people of the world are acquitted of all wrongdoing. The
declaration of innocence by God brings life to people.</p>
<p>The Mosaic law was added to increase sin. God&rsquo;s purpose wasn&rsquo;t so that
people would sin more but that they would be aware of the magnitude of
their sin before God. Now there were specific commands and as people
failed to keep them perfectly in thought, word and deed, they would
realize how numerous their sins were. With God&rsquo;s total forgiveness for
all sin, they realized even more the magnitude of God&rsquo;s grace. We not
only live in that grace God wants &ldquo;grace to reign&rdquo; (21) in human
hearts through Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="13">
<li>
<p>How does grace &ldquo;increase all the more&rdquo; when an awareness of sin and
its consequences increases? (20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give some ways that &ldquo;grace&rdquo; rules or reigns over &ldquo;sin&rdquo; in believers,
hearts and lives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
