	<p><strong>GOD&rsquo;S DECLARATION OF NOT GUILTY IS FOR ALL PEOPLE</strong></p>
<p>Romans 3:21 &ndash; 3:31</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Why do we need to continually apply the law to our own heart?</p>
<p><strong>Romans 3:21-24</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul stated the dreadful predicament every human being faces before
God in the previous chapters. Every single person, no matter what
race, Jew or Gentile, moral or immoral, religious or irreligious, is
guilty and without excuse before God. Suddenly in vs 21, he begins,
&ldquo;But now.&rdquo; There is a righteousness (see Greek word below), a
declaration of innocence that has its source in God. It has nothing to
do with obedience to the law. God has revealed it. He has put it out
into the open for all to see. The Law and the prophets (Old Testament
writers) spoke of free forgiveness through faith not only for the Jews
but also for the Gentiles. Twice (vs 21,22) Paul emphasized this
righteousness comes from God. How does this righteousness come to an
individual person? Through faith in Jesus, we simply believe what God
has said.</p>
<p>Once again he states that there is no difference between Jew and
Gentile &ndash; every single human being has sinned. Those same people,
every single human being, were declared not guilty by the payment
Christ made for the world. God repeatedly says that the whole world
was declared not guilty through Jesus sacrifice. God recorded John the
Baptists words for us, &ldquo;Look the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
[the world]{.ul}.&rdquo; (Jn 1:29) God&rsquo;s Word says, &ldquo;God was reconciling
[the world]{.ul} to himself in Christ, not counting men&rsquo;s sins against
them&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:19). The Bible says, &ldquo;For there is one God and one
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself
as a ransom for [all men]{.ul}.&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:5) Of course we could
simply recall Jesus words, &ldquo;For God so loved [the world]{.ul} that he
gave his one and only Son&rdquo; (Jn 3:16). Jesus didn&rsquo;t give himself for
some percentage of the world&rsquo;s population. He gave himself for the
world &ndash; yes all human beings. Every single human being has been
declared not guilty before God through Jesus. That declaration is
given freely. We can&rsquo;t in any way earn it or somehow pay for it. It is
a gift from God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KEYWORD: RIGHTEOUSNESS</strong> &ndash; Declare not guilty.</p>
<p>A word that comes from the courtroom of the Romans. It means that a
judge has declared a person cleared of the charge that was brought
against him.</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does this section of Romans and all of Scripture bring out the
teaching that the whole world has been declared not guilty before
God?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does God&rsquo;s world-wide declaration of innocence become the
possession of an individual person? (22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the whole world has been declared innocent, why doesn&rsquo;t
everybody go to heaven?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why can you walk up to any person anywhere and confidently say to
them, &ldquo;Jesus has paid for your sins. You are forgiven before God&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 3:25-26</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul continues to describe how God had all people declared not guilty
before him without compromising his holy justice to punish wrongdoing.
In vs 25 the word translated, &ldquo;God presented him&rdquo; has the idea of
something or someone set out in front of people, doing a public
display. God did something very public with his Son. He calls it &ldquo;a
sacrifice of atonement.&rdquo; That is an interesting word. It means &ldquo;to
satisfy someone so his anger is gone.&rdquo; The word is also connected to
the Old Testament Great Day of Atonement, celebrated every year.
Professor Panning explained one aspect of that festival in the
People&rsquo;s Bible. There is another aspect to it. The high priest took
the blood of an animal into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled it on the
cover of the Ark of the Covenant. Atonement was made for sin. God was
satisfied so his anger over sin was gone. Everybody knew an animal
didn&rsquo;t take away sin before God, but this symbolized what would take
place when Messiah came. Jesus blood was offered in the Holy of Holies
in heaven (Heb 9:11-14). The cover of the ark was where God&rsquo;s justice
and his mercy meet. With Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice God&rsquo;s justice and mercy
met. The sin of the world was not forgotten but was punished through
Jesus blood. Paul emphasizes that God had left the sins of Old
Testament people unpunished. He was patient, waiting until Jesus came.
So God is just &ndash; he punishes wrong doing and also the one who
justifies. Jesus payment for the sin of the world becomes ours simply
through faith as we believe what Jesus did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KEYWORD: SACRIFICE OF ATONEMENT</strong> &ndash; Satisfy someone so his anger is
gone</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>What comes first God&rsquo;s declaration of not guilty because of Jesus or
faith in Jesus?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus paid for the sins of everybody. That means even the people
that end up in hell had their sins paid for. Why did they end up in
hell if Jesus paid for their sins?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 3:27-31</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boasting is a part of our self-centered sinful nature. Some cultures
may express it more forcefully in words and other cultures or people
may keep boasting confined to their thoughts. But all boasting is
excluded in the Christian faith because we do nothing to get acquitted
before God. Jesus did it all with his life and death for all people.
God gives us a right standing before him simply through faith in Jesus
blood. The word translated, &ldquo;we maintain&rdquo; vs. 28 has the idea of
thinking something through very carefully and then the word can
include what one realizes after thinking it through carefully. After
thinking through carefully what God&rsquo;s Word says, it is obvious we are
acquitted before God through faith in Jesus and not by anything we
might do. Jew and Gentile alike are not guilty before God through
faith in Jesus. I suspect you noticed in vs 30 the words, &ldquo;will
justify&rdquo;. How does that fit in with everything Paul has been saying?
Remember the first point &ndash; Jesus came to take away the sin of the
world. His life and death for all humans produced the Father&rsquo;s verdict
of not guilty for all humans. The second point made: that universal
acquittal becomes the possession of an individual person through trust
in Jesus. Faith being created in people will continue into the future
and they will receive the benefit of what Christ did for them. Faith
doesn&rsquo;t contribute anything to our acquittal before God. It receives
that acquittal through believing what God has said.</p>
<p>Paul doesn&rsquo;t want a wrong impression to be given. He isn&rsquo;t saying in
all of this that the law is useless. It has a very important purpose.
The law still reveals our sin and the very just anger God has with us.
If we don&rsquo;t understand the anger of God over our rebellion against
him, we can&rsquo;t understand it being satisfied at the cross through Jesus
death for us. God&rsquo;s law and gospel are vital in the Christian faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>Why is boasting about ourselves and how we live contrary to the
Christian faith?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are law and gospel both important to be shared with people?</p>
</li>
</ol>
