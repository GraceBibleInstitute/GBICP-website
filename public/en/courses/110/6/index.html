	<p><strong>GOD PORTRAYS ABRAHAM AS</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE FATHER OF ALL BELIEVERS</strong></p>
<p>Romans 4:16 &ndash;25</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you say that an Old Testament person got to be innocent before
God and thus got to heaven in the same way or a different way from a
New Testament believer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROMANS 4:16-17</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In last week&rsquo;s reading, Paul said that law, any kind of law, will
bring transgression which will result in God&rsquo;s anger. The law always
demands, &ldquo;do&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do&rdquo; but we always fail to be perfect. Notice
the first word of vs 16, &ldquo;therefore&rdquo;, Paul is now making a conclusion.
The promise of being a forgiven child of God comes by faith. It is by
grace. It is a free gift given by God. Since it is given by God, it
can be guaranteed (16). Paul makes the same point that this guaranteed
promise is for Jew and Gentile alike. Abraham is the father of us all
(16). Notice an important point &ndash; a believer in God&rsquo;s promise of a
Savior is a child of Abraham, a member of his family. It doesn&rsquo;t make
any difference if we are Jewish, or northern European, from the far
east, Africa or the western world. Whoever has the same faith as
Abraham is part of his family and thus a part of God&rsquo;s family. Faith
in what Jesus has done for humanity unites us all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many guarantees that we experience from companies have limits and
exceptions. How is God&rsquo;s guarantee different?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the thought that you are a child of Abraham a new thought for
you? Why is it an important point?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 4:17b-25</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>God had spoken what may seem to be impossible promises. Abraham and
Sarah were going to have a child. There were two major obstacles, both
Abraham and Sarah were beyond the age of having children. From the
perspective of child-bearing, they were both as good as dead. In spite
of that, God still, &ldquo;calls things that are not as though they
were.&quot;(17) The eventual child, Isaac, didn&rsquo;t exist yet God spoke as
though he did.</p>
<p>The word translated, &ldquo;he faced the fact&rdquo; (19) has the idea of someone
thinking deeply about something. Abraham realized reality, he and
Sarah were well beyond the age of becoming parents. He wasn&rsquo;t blind to
reality. He wasn&rsquo;t a simpleton. He just believed God had the power and
the will to do what he said, no matter what the physical circumstances
were (21). He trusted what God promised, &ldquo;This is why &lsquo;it was credited
to him as righteousness.&rdquo; (22) Those words were written for your
assurance as well, God does the same through faith in his promise of
forgiveness through Jesus.</p>
<p>Vs.24 &ndash; Why did the Father hand over his son to death? He did it for
our sins, because of our sin. Why did the Father raise Jesus to life?
He did it for our justification. We were declared not guilty when
Jesus was still on the cross. He had paid for the sin of the world.
Because we were declared not guilty already on Good Friday, God raised
Jesus to life. He was raised to life to proclaim the victory, here was
real life evidence that sin had been paid for by Jesus. He is risen!!
Alleluia! Our forgiveness is assured &ndash; believe it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>What comfort can we take in the fact that God gives life to the dead
and calls things into existence that did not exist before? (v.17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was the basis for Abraham&rsquo;s hope for the future? (v.18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List some promises of God that are the basis for our hope in the
future?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give an example of times when God leads us to &ldquo;hope&rdquo; &ndash; believe in
the face of human hopelessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Abraham&rsquo;s experience with God in the matter of receiving
righteousness benefit us? Vs 23-24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to vs 25, what was the purpose of:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus death?</p>
<p>Jesus being raised to life?</p>
<p><strong>[PREPARING FOR NEXT WEEK&rsquo;S CLASS]{.ul}</strong></p>

</ol>
