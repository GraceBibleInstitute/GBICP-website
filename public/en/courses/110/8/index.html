<p>Romans 6:1 &ndash;14</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the two main points that Paul brings out in 5:12&ndash;21?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROMANS 6:1&ndash;4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul stated previously, &ldquo;Where sin increased, grace increased all the
more.&rdquo; (5:20) Paul&rsquo;s point was that with the giving of the law of
Moses, human beings became more aware of all the commands they
disobeyed. They have a growing understanding of the depth and darkness
of their guilt and a greater understanding of the depth and height of
God&rsquo;s grace. When some people heard that, they reasoned then lets
continue to sin so that God&rsquo;s grace can shine more and more. Paul
rejected that line of thought in the strongest of terms.</p>
<p>He discusses what happens when a person is baptized. Baptized in
Christ, connects us to the acquittal that Christ already accomplished
and it becomes ours through faith. As a result of Spirit implanted
faith a new attitude is instilled in us. Because of our new
relationship with Jesus, we no longer have the same relationship with
sin. We don&rsquo;t love sinning any more. In Paul&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;We died to sin&rdquo;
(2). That loving relationship with sin is over. So his question, &ldquo;How
can we live in it (sin) any longer?&rdquo; (2) Baptism connected us to
Jesus, his death and his resurrection. With the death of Christ, he
carried our sin, once for all. Jesus would never have anything to do
with sin again. All the world&rsquo;s sin was paid by Jesus. He died to sin
(10). In our baptism we are connected to Jesus and his payment for sin
and like Jesus died to the mastery of sin. (14)</p>
<p>In our baptism we were also connected to the resurrection of Jesus. In
Paul&rsquo;s words that &ldquo;we too may live a new life&rdquo; (4). In this new
relationship with Jesus, we have a new attitude in life. In thankful
love for his grace filled forgiveness, we want to serve our Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KEYWORD: GRACE</strong> &ndash; God&rsquo;s undeserved love for all people expressed by
Jesus coming to pay for all sin</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What powerful work and blessing does baptism bring to a person?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the parallel in these verses between Christ and us in his
death and in his resurrection?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 6:5 &ndash; 11</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul begins this section stating that &ldquo;We have been united with him in
his death&hellip;in his resurrection&rdquo; (5). With the completed payment for
sin by Christ, he was done with sin. He didn&rsquo;t have anything to do
with it anymore. He was dead to it. We in our baptism are united to
his death, we no longer want anything to do with sin. It no longer has
total dominance over us &ndash; we are no longer slaves to it (6). In
baptism we are united to his resurrection &ndash; &ldquo;we will also live with
him.&rdquo; (8) We live this new life now and on into the future. A new life
because we are &ldquo;alive to God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; (11) The believer has a
new identity, dead to sin &ndash; no longer wants to sin (although we
obviously still have sins of weakness that Paul will address later)
and a new desire to live to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>What is the risen Christ&rsquo;s relationship with death? (9-10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the positive result of our old sinful nature being crucified
with Christ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it mean, &ldquo;Jesus lives to God&rdquo;? (10)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 6:12&ndash;14</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul has stressed the new attitude that we have because of Jesus in
the previous sections. Now he begins to outline how that attitude
works out into the actions of life. While we have a new identity in
Christ, the battle with sin continues throughout our life. He
emphasizes both the negative, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let sin reign&rdquo; and the positive,
&ldquo;offer yourselves to God&rdquo;. Our sinful nature will raise its ugly head
to present evil desires that can be expressed through our eyes, ears,
hands, feet and every part of our body. We don&rsquo;t let sin rule by
defeating those desires but also by repentance. We come before our
Savior God with sorrow over our failures, hear his wonderous assurance
of forgiveness and a desire to live a new life in Christ. We offer the
same parts of our body to serve our God in the actions of our daily
life. Our motivation isn&rsquo;t the demands of the law or a compulsion to
keep the law to satisfy God. We are forgiven through Christ. We live
under grace. His love demonstrated toward us through Christ motivates
us. His pure love freely given prompts and grows our thankful love.
Our motivation is the Gospel. God&rsquo;s gracious good news powers our
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>As people who are alive in Christ and dead to sin, what will
believers:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A) refuse to do? 12-13a</p>
<p>B) strive to do? 13b</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>Give some examples of how we can use our bodies in either</li>
</ol>
<p>[The service of sin]{.ul} [The service of God]{.ul}</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Identify some differences between law being our master and grace
being our master.</li>

<li>
<p>Read Romans 6:15&ndash;7:6 a second time but this time out loud.</p>

<p>How does being &ldquo;under grace&rdquo; change everything in life?</p>
