	<p><strong>GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT IS DESERVED UPON ALL JEWISH PEOPLE</strong></p>
<p>Romans 2:17-3:20</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be prepared to answer: Every person you ever meet in your life has a
conscience. A conscience that in part is telling them they have done
some things that are wrong. How can that be helpful as we share our
faith with someone?</p>
<p>What is the meaning and thought of the word &ldquo;declare righteous?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROMANS 2:17-24</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the previous section (Romans 2:1-16) Paul spoke about people who
lived very moral lives. They could have been Gentiles or Jews, but
their lives were marked with far better morals than those described
and convicted of guilt in Romans 1. They are however, still guilty
because they haven&rsquo;t consistently kept the law.</p>
<p>Now Paul turns his attention to the Jews in particular. He begins with
a series of clauses. Each starts with the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;. The thought of
each clause is a common held perception the Jews had of themselves.
They would have quickly agreed with the points. I am glad I am a Jew,
I have the law of God and I am in a relationship with God. I know his
will because we are the nation that received the revelations from God.
I have tested the law and approve of what really matters in life. I am
constantly taught by the law.</p>
<p>Paul makes a turn in the thought in verse 19. He portrayed their
privileged position as a Jew. Now he describes the attitude of the Jew
toward others. The Jews felt they were in a position to help the
spiritually blind, to teach those in the dark about knowing the true
God, to instruct those who didn&rsquo;t have a clue (foolish) about God, to
help the helpless (infants) to understand the living Lord.</p>
<p>The Jews were in a unique position but now Paul suddenly starts
raising some questions. Were they learning and applying God&rsquo;s law to
themselves? With each question the initial answer might be, &ldquo;No, I
don&rsquo;t do those things.&rdquo; After a closer examination, they would have to
confess, &ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo; Their hypocrisy was obvious to the Gentiles
and they weren&rsquo;t attracted to the Lord but rather spoke against the
God of Israel. They couldn&rsquo;t claim salvation on the basis of the law
and obedience. They were sinners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We like the Jews also are privileged to have and learn from God&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Word. Why do we need to apply God&rsquo;s law to our lives as Paul is
doing here to the Jews?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can God&rsquo;s name be blasphemed (dishonored) in the eyes of people</p>
<blockquote>
<p>around us?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember there is no gospel in these early chapters of Romans, as we</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apply these words to ourselves why do we need to flee to Jesus for
comfort and strength?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 2:25-29</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jew could still think, but I have been circumcised. That will
count before God. Paul demolishes that thought! Paul&rsquo;s first point is
that circumcision only has value if the law is still kept perfectly.
If one breaks the law, circumcision wouldn&rsquo;t help, the person is like
an uncircumcised individual (vs 25). If the Jew is like an
uncircumcised person, they aren&rsquo;t part of God&rsquo;s people. In verse 26,
Paul reverses it. If an uncircumcised person keeps God&rsquo;s law
consistently (in theory &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t possible because we are all
sinners) they will be regarded as a child of God (circumcised).</p>
<p>Paul continues by saying the Gentile (uncircumcised) will condemn the
Jew who hasn&rsquo;t kept God&rsquo;s law perfectly. Is that what Jesus was saying
in Matthew 12:41-42? The Gentiles who heard God&rsquo;s call to repentance
will stand in judgment over the Jews who rejected the Savior. The
Jewish trust in their family background, their partial obedience to
God&rsquo;s will and that they were outwardly circumcised has been blown
apart by these words.</p>
<p>Paul isn&rsquo;t done. In verse 28-29, he makes the point that circumcision
is something inward worked by the Spirt in someone&rsquo;s heart and has an
outward action to remind the person they are a child of God. A Jew
before God is first someone whose heart has been changed by the
Spirit. This isn&rsquo;t a new thought in Scripture. Remember Old Testament
passages where God spoke of Israel&rsquo;s uncircumcised hearts (Leviticus
26:41)? God called upon Israel to circumcise their hearts (Deuteronomy
10:16, 30:6). Circumcision was always spiritual with an outward sign
to remind each person. Circumcision was always a cutting of the heart
(cutting away sin &ndash; repentance) and a trust in the compassionate and
gracious God who forgave their sin through the promised Messiah.</p>
<p>Notice that the identity of God&rsquo;s people isn&rsquo;t based on family or
obedience but on the Spirit working in the heart of a person. The
Bible says, &ldquo;If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, and
heirs according to the promise&rdquo; (Galatians 3:29). The believer in
Jesus is Abraham&rsquo;s seed &ndash; a descendant of Abraham &ndash; not by a
physical connection but by a faith like Abraham trusting God&rsquo;s word
and promise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>What can be some dangerous thoughts or attitudes (similar to the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jews) that could give us a false sense of security that we are
God&rsquo;s children?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>In what way could it be said that every believer, no matter what</p>
<blockquote>
<p>their ethnic background, is a Jew? 28-29</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 3:1-4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul has made the strong point that simply being a circumcised Jew
doesn&rsquo;t result in the person being a child of God and an heir of
eternal life. An inward circumcision of the heart, a belief in God&rsquo;s
Word was critical. This was jarring for most Jews because they
believed the most important things were outward. Anticipating their
object he asks their question, What is the advantage of being a Jew?
He answers quickly you have the inspired Word of God. If someone
doesn&rsquo;t believe the Word of God that doesn&rsquo;t make God&rsquo;s Word a lie.
God&rsquo;s Word remains true and will never be proved false.</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty of this section is that Paul moves quickly from
one question to an answer to another logical question that might be
raised and then a quick answer again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>What important reminder for us is found in vs. 1-2?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does God&rsquo;s absolute faithfulness even when we are unfaithful</p>
<blockquote>
<p>give us encouragement and strength?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 3:5-8</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Paul continues his rapid fire questions and answers, we get the
impression these were actual human arguments that he has heard people
raise. People do try to challenge the Christian faith by using human
not G odly logic. The questions raised end up trying to ridicule
Christianity by setting up some false logical conclusions that end up
saying, &ldquo;Do evil so that God looks holier and more just!&rdquo; The
accusation has even been made that was Paul&rsquo;s teaching. Paul destroys
each question. He finally simply says, &ldquo;Their condemnation is
deserved.&rdquo; (Romans 3:8) Remember the ongoing point unbelieving Jews
are also guilty before God and every attempt to say anything different
will only end in judgment of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Someone might argue, &ldquo;If you tell someone their sins are completely,
<blockquote>
<p>fully paid for by Jesus and you simply invite them to believe it.
They will then sin all the more because they think they have
forgiveness.&rdquo; How would you respond?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 3:9-18</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jews are not in a better position nor a worse position before God.
Paul gives the reason in the second half of verse 9 &ldquo;all under sin.&rdquo;
We are all under the continuing condition of sin&rsquo;s domination. Paul
uses seven Old Testament quotations to support his point of the
universal nature of sin among humans. He says twice - all have gone
their own way; four times &ndash; no one is righteous; two times &ndash; not
even one. There are no exceptions &ndash; God can&rsquo;t find anyone who has
kept his will perfectly.</p>
<p>He then portrays the terrible results of sin in the world. As an open
grave with a body decaying in it has a strong odor, so are our sinful
throats whose words are foul smelling before God. Mouths that speak
deceitful words, hurtful words (poison), cursing or bitter words.
Bitter words are rebellion against God as we are angry or frustrated
with a difficulty that God has allowed into our life. The actions of
humans reflect sin as well (vs. 15-16). As people live in this
rebellion there is no respect for God but only refusal to listen to
him and a lifting up of self before God. The evidence of the
universality of sin is seen in every single human being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>What does it mean to be &ldquo;under sin&rdquo; (vs 9)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&rdquo; (18) How is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the root sin of all others?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 3:19-20</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last word of this section is &ldquo;sin.&rdquo; Literally the Greek word means
to miss the mark. It is used in the context of archery and an arrow
missing the bull&rsquo;s eye. This obviously is an important word in the
Bible. God&rsquo;s law identifies the target we are to hit with a perfect
obedience but we miss the mark. We fail to keep it perfectly and so we
fall short of hitting the center of the target. Because of the law we
are aware, conscious, of the fact that we are sinful. The law only
brings us a knowledge of our sin, not the forgiveness of sins. Since
we cannot find the perfection inside of us, we will only find it
outside of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KEYWORD: SIN</strong> &ndash; Miss the mark, failing to hit the bull&rsquo;s eye of
perfection to the law</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p>What does the word &ldquo;accountable to God&rdquo; communicate to you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do we have to keep teaching the law over and over again to God&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote>
<p>people?</p>
