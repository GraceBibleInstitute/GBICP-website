<p>Romans 8:18 &ndash; 39</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since we aren&rsquo;t slaves to fear in Christ (15) what kind of attitudes
and confidence can we have in Christ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROMANS 8: 18 &ndash; 25</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will look at several words and their meanings. Paul uses the word
translated, &ldquo;consider&rdquo; (18). That word has the idea of thinking about
something carefully until one reaches a conclusion. The word
translated, &ldquo;comparing&rdquo; (18) has the picture of an old balance scale,
where weights are put on one side to determine the weight of another
object on the other side. Once both are equal in weight it is
balanced. Paul&rsquo;s point is I thought about this carefully no amount of
present suffering (physical, mental, emotional) will come close to our
eternal glory that will be the believers in heaven. There is no amount
of suffering in this world that we might endure that would make our
eternal inheritance no longer worth it.</p>
<p>All of creation was impacted by mankind&rsquo;s fall into sin. As a result
of God&rsquo;s judgment in the Garden of Eden, all of creation was subjected
to &ldquo;frustration&rdquo; (20). Creation cannot accomplish its purpose for
which it was created perfectly. Paul portrays creation as waiting for
Jesus glorious return when creation also will be able to be a perfect
creation again. Like creation we also groan inwardly (23) sin, disease
and catastrophes also deeply impact us. At the same time we have a
hope for the future, we are eagerly waiting for our bodies to be
glorified (23) at Jesus return. God has already given us the Holy
Spirit, which is his guarantee (23) that he will also bring about the
final step, our physical bodies freed from sin. Since this is in the
future, it is a hope. A sure and certain hope because the God who sent
his Son to redeem us will also keep this promise. We eagerly wait with
patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give three examples to show that the created world has been made
&ldquo;subject to frustration&rdquo; because of sin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What future awaits the created world (vs 19-21)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What great expectation do God&rsquo;s children hold on to in the midst of
their present difficulties? (vs 18,23)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 8: 26 &ndash; 30</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At times, we don&rsquo;t know what to pray. We don&rsquo;t know what the will of
God is for us. Paul assures us that the Spirit prays on our behalf.
The Spirit asks for the right solution. The Spirit and the Father have
the same agenda and so the Spirit can pray &ldquo;in accordance with God&rsquo;s
will&rdquo; (27). The &ldquo;we&rdquo; is clearly described in vs 17, &ldquo;Now if we are
children, then we are heirs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Paul begins vs 28 with the &ldquo;we know&rdquo;. The basis for what we know is
explained in vs 29-30. What we know can be outlined in five points: 1)
God works &ndash; he is ceaselessly involved with each believer. 2) for
good &ndash; not necessarily for our earthly comfort but for our eternal
salvation &ndash; again vs. 29-30 brings out that perspective. 3) All
things &ndash; not occasionally or just things we pray about. 4) those who
love him &ndash; not everyone on earth but the believers. 5) according to
his purpose &ndash; life isn&rsquo;t a series of random events but God has
purpose in them for our spiritual good. How can we know these things
are true? Listen to Paul&rsquo;s list of five aspects of God&rsquo;s grace in each
believer.</p>
<p>In verses 29-30 we are told of the eternal good God is working toward.
It started in eternity past in God&rsquo;s foreknowledge and predestination
of believers. It was carried out in time as those predestined were
brought to faith (called) through the Gospel proclaimed. With faith
created each believer now has received the absolute assurance of sin
forgiven already in Jesus. Each believer can anticipate a certain
eternal glory. Each step is rooted in God&rsquo;s grace and flows from him
to us. We contribute nothing in any of this. So we can be totally
certain, even in suffering, that God is at work for our good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>What special help does the Holy Spirit provide for sin weakened and
weary believers? (26-27)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it important to remember that God is working all things for
our spiritual good?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore God&rsquo;s grace filled works in vs. 29-30</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A. When God foreknows a person, he &hellip;</p>
<p>B. When God predestines a person, he &hellip;</p>
<p>C. When God calls a person, he &hellip;</p>
<p>D. When God justifies a person, he &hellip;</p>
<p>E. When God glorifies a person, he &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>How can you help a person who wonders whether God has chosen him/her
to be saved?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you help a person who wonders what caused God to choose
him/her to be saved?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 8: 31 &ndash; 39</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul continues with a series of questions and each one has an obvious
answer. His first question isn&rsquo;t simply, &ldquo;Who can be against us?&rdquo; The
answers could be many. His question starts with a condition, If
(since) God is for us &ndash; whoever may be against us in this world, they
can&rsquo;t stand up to God&rsquo;s love and strength. There isn&rsquo;t any doubt about
God&rsquo;s love for us. He gave his only Son, his greatest treasure for us.
Since he gave up his son for us, we can be sure he will to do anything
for us. Satan may accuse us (Rev.12:10) or our own sinful heart may
condemn us as unable to be forgiven by God, nevertheless we have been
acquitted by God because of Jesus death and resurrection. He also is
at God&rsquo;s right hand pleading for us on the basis of his suffering and
death.</p>
<p>Look at what God has already done for us in Christ. His love for us is
beyond compare. God&rsquo;s love for us will not be overcome or diminished
by anything on earth. With God&rsquo;s fervent love for us we don&rsquo;t just
survive in difficulties we are more than conquers! God&rsquo;s love for us
in Christ Jesus is our strength. His steadfast and abundant love will
remain no matter what the earthly circumstances. Our confidence is
rooted in Christ and his overflowing love demonstrated for us at the
cross.</p>
</blockquote>

predestined by grace</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>In vs 31-35 Paul asks a series of questions with obvious answers to
help us respond to God&rsquo;s wonderful works of love with confident

<p>A. Vs. 31</p>
