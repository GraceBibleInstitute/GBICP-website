	<p><strong>GOD SAVES THROUGH FAITH IN JESUS,</strong></p>
<p><strong>TWO OLD TESTAMENT EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>Romans 4:1 &ndash; 15</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Review Scripture and be prepared to talk about how Jesus life, death
and resurrection resulted in God declaring everybody not guilty before
him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ROMANS 4:1 - 8</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul previously said that the Old Testament, the law and the prophets
(3:21) testified that we are acquitted before God through faith. Now
he gives two examples. Abraham, the father of the nation and David,
the great king of the nation are used to emphasize the point.</p>
<p>In the case of Abraham Paul says he had nothing to brag about before
God. If he had done even just a small part to earn his acquittal, he
would have something to brag about. That isn&rsquo;t how Abraham was cleared
of all wrong doing before God. In the context of Genesis 15, God told
Abraham a child would come from his own body and a nation so numerous
would follow that they would be like the stars in the sky. Previously
God had promised that the Savior would come from his family line (Gen.
12:3). Abraham simply believed what God said. Paul quotes word for
word the passage from Gen. 15:6. The word translated &ldquo;credited&rdquo; (vs 3)
is used frequently in business transactions. It involves putting
something on a person&rsquo;s account as a credit. Notice God put it on
Abraham&rsquo;s account, Abraham didn&rsquo;t put it on his account. God put on
Abraham&rsquo;s account, &ldquo;acquitted, cleared of all sin, not guilty&rdquo;. What
did Abraham do? Nothing &ndash; he just believed what God said to him.</p>
<p>There are two ways to get a credit on your account. One can work for
it or it can be given. God acquitted the non-worker (vs 5). It was a
gift given to the one who trusts God. Notice it describes God as the
one &ldquo;who justifies the wicked.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t say the believer but the
wicked. We are all wicked before God by nature aren&rsquo;t we? The wicked,
the entire mass of humanity, were acquitted, declared not guilty. The
one who believes God&rsquo;s statement receives that forgiveness</p>
<p>David provides the same lesson. This is a quote from Psalm 32:1-2.
David starts with a generalization and then in the following verses
explains how he tried to hide his sin, but then confessed it and the
forgiveness God was proclaimed to him. In the quote David is simply
saying how happy a person is who knows their transgressions and sins
are forgiven. He speaks of &ldquo;transgressions&rdquo; &ndash; many lawless acts a
person has done in their life. He speaks of &ldquo;sins&rdquo; &ndash; many failures to
fall short of what God demands. God forgave, covered them. Any sin in
the future, God will not count against them. All of this happens
simply through faith in God&rsquo;s word of acquittal. Both are held up as
examples of Old Testament believers, none more prominent that Abraham
and David, who were declared not guilty before God simply through
faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>KEYWORD: CREDITED &ndash;</strong> Putting something on a person&rsquo;s account as a
credit</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How are wages and a gift different and how does that apply to our
spiritual life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does Scripture teach about how Abraham became righteous before
God?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Paul stress that righteousness is a pure gift from God? Vs
5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference in meaning of the words &ldquo;transgressions&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sins&rdquo;? Vs 7</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do verses 7-8 support the truth that God credits righteousness
apart from works?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 4:9 - 12</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul made the point that Abraham and David were both cleared of all
wrongdoing before God simply through faith in the Messiah. Since both
of them were Jews, he wants to be sure that a wrong impression isn&rsquo;t
given. He refers to Abraham. He was credited with being acquitted of
all wrongdoing long before he was ever circumcised. Circumcision came
nearly 20 years later. Circumcision was a sign, a seal, that in an
outward way reminded Abraham that he was credited with forgiveness
earlier in time. Circumcision was a sign that identified a person as
belonging to God&rsquo;s family through faith. Abraham was an uncircumcised
believer and thus is a spiritual father of all uncircumcised
believers. Abraham was also a circumcised believer and thus a
spiritual father of all circumcised believers. All who believe as
Abraham believed God&rsquo;s Word are spiritual children of Abraham. Every
believer can claim Abraham as a spiritual father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>Why is it important to see that Abraham was acquitted of all sin
before he was circumcised?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can Abraham bear the name &ldquo;father of all who believe &ndash; whether
circumcised or not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes you a child of Abraham?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ROMANS 4:13-15</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abraham wasn&rsquo;t declared not guilty because of circumcision (9-12) nor
was it because of any law that he was given and kept (13-15). Paul was
very methodically removing every thought which someone might have to
still believe I have to obey God in order to receive his promise. Law
only produces anger &ndash; some say God&rsquo;s anger over disobedience, others
argue man&rsquo;s anger because it is an impossible demand to keep law.
Either way it results in anger. A right standing before God comes only
through believing what he has promised and done in Jesus (13b).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>Why do efforts to live by the law make faith and God&rsquo;s gospel
promise worthless?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give two examples of religious beliefs and practices that express a
&ldquo;live by law&rdquo; teaching and mindset.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>[PREPARING FOR NEXT WEEK&rsquo;S CLASS]{.ul}</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read Romans 4:16 &ndash; 25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read Romans &ndash; the People&rsquo;s Bible Pages 74-78</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read Romans 4:16 &ndash; 25 a second time but this time out loud.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Would you say that an Old Testament person got to be innocent before God
and thus got to heaven in the same way or a different way from a New
Testament believer?</p>
