        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-expectation&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH EXPECTATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today most Jewish people believe that the Messianic prophecies were about a ____________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the New Testament there was an expectation that the Messiah would be ____________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people in Jesus’ day expected that the Messiah:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a)	__________________________________________________ (Matthew 2:4–7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b)	__________________________________________________ (Matthew 22:42)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c)	____________________________________________ (John 7:26-27; John 7:41–42)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d)	__________________________________________________ (John 4:25-26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e)	__________________________________________________ (Luke 24:20–21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f)	   __________________________________________________ (John 12:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-messiah&#34;&gt;WHAT IS A MESSIAH?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament the word for “Messiah” was ______________________ which means  _____________________________________ .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To “anoint” means ______________________
__________________.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something or someone was anointed in a religious ritual it meant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were the three offices for which a ceremonial rite of anointing was used?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the New Testament the Greek word for Messiah is ___________________________&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messianic prophecy speaks of the Messiah coming twice. What are those two times:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the four categories of Messianic prophecy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know for sure when an Old Testament prophecy is Messianic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT ARE THE THREE KINDS OF MESSIANIC PROPHECY?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-in-the-writings-of-moses&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE WRITINGS OF MOSES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is the first of three lessons that will examine the Messianic prophecies in the writings of Moses (sometimes called the Torah or the Law). The three lessons will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 2 = The Messiah is Promised to Adam and Eve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 3 = The Messiah is Promised to Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 4 = The Messiah is Promised to the Children of Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-messianic-prophecy&#34;&gt;THE FIRST MESSIANIC PROPHECY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GENESIS 3:15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the context of this verse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“SO THE LORD GOD SAID TO THE SERPENT…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GENESIS 3:14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, “Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did God call the serpent in 3:1?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 3:14 God is talking to the serpent. Write down a Bible reference that teaches us that the serpent was actually Satan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will crawl on your belly” (Genesis 3:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the significance of “crawling on your belly”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“you will eat dust all the days of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the significance of “eating dust”? (see Micah 7:17; Isaiah 49:23; Psalm 72:9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;snakes-or-satan&#34;&gt;SNAKES OR SATAN?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was God cursing an animal or cursing Satan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verse-15&#34;&gt;VERSE 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”” (Genesis 3:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will put enmity between you and the woman”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is “enmity”? (see Numbers 35:21-22; Ezekiel 25:15; Ezekiel 35:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will God direct ENMITY toward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“and between your offspring and hers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are the “offspring” of Satan? (see Matthew 13:38-39; John 8:44; 1 John 3:8-13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are the “offspring” of the woman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this phrase “he” refers to only one person, one descendant of the woman. What is remarkable about the fact that this person of called the offspring of a WOMAN (and not a MAN)? (see Galatians 4:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose head will be crushed? And what is the significance of that? (see 1 John 3:8; Romans 16:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of the phrase “and you will strike his heel”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;protevangelium&#34;&gt;PROTEVANGELIUM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of the word “protevangelium”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did God decide to do what he promises in this verse? (see 1 Peter 1:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this verse tell us about God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-in-the-writings-of-moses&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE WRITINGS OF MOSES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is the second of three lessons that will examine the Messianic prophecies in the writings of Moses (sometimes called the Torah or the Law). The three lessons will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 2 = The Messiah is Promised to Adam and Eve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 3 = The Messiah is Promised to Abraham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 4 = The Messiah is Promised to the Children of Israel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-call-of-abram--genesis-121-7&#34;&gt;THE CALL OF ABRAM – GENESIS 12:1-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What three things did the Lord ask of Abram (verse 1)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was God doing with these instructions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What were the 8 promises God made to Abraham in Genesis 12:1-7?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(v.7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-will-make-you-into-a-great-nation-v2&#34;&gt;“I will make you into a great nation” (v.2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did God mean by “great?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-will-bless-you-v2&#34;&gt;“I will bless you” (v.2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did God choose to bless Abraham?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-will-make-your-name-great-v2&#34;&gt;“I will make your name great” (v2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did this promise give purpose to Abraham’s life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-will-be-a-blessing&#34;&gt;“you will be a blessing”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would Abraham be a blessing to others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-will-bless-those-who-bless-you-v3&#34;&gt;“I will bless those who bless you” (v.3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give an example of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whoever-curses-you-i-will-curse-v3&#34;&gt;“whoever curses you I will curse” (v.3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give an example of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-peoples-on-earth-will-be-blessed-through-you-v3&#34;&gt;“all peoples on earth will be blessed through you” (v.3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we believe that this was a Messianic promise (a promise of a Savior)? (see Acts 3:24-26)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will the Messiah bring blessings to all people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;galatians-36-8&#34;&gt;Galatians 3:6-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does Paul call this promise to Abraham?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are the blessings of the promise received?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the words “all nations” who was God referring to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;15&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was the way of salvation any different for Abraham than it is for us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How, then, would Abraham and his family share the blessing with other families of the earth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-856&#34;&gt;John 8:56&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did Jesus mean? How did Abraham “see His day”? How did he “rejoice in it”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-127-to-your-offspring&#34;&gt;GENESIS 12:7 “to your offspring”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is Shechem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does this promise reveal about the Messiah?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-promise-repeated--genesis-1314-18&#34;&gt;THE PROMISE REPEATED – GENESIS 13:14-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle the promises originally given to Abraham in 12:1-7 that were repeated here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will make you a great nation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will bless you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will make your name great&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will make you a blessing to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will bless those who bless you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will curse those who curse you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will bless all people on earth through you and your descendants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To your offspring I will give this land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did Abraham keep building altars to the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-promise-confirmed-by-a-covenant--genesis-151-21&#34;&gt;THE PROMISE CONFIRMED BY A COVENANT – GENESIS 15:1-21&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-in-the-writings-of-moses&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE WRITINGS OF MOSES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final lesson that on the Messianic prophecies in the writings of Moses (sometimes called the Torah or the Law). The three lessons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 2 = The Messiah is Promised to Adam and Eve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 3 = The Messiah is Promised to Abraham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 4 = The Messiah is Promised to the Children of Israel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-lion-of-judah--genesis-498-12&#34;&gt;THE LION OF JUDAH – GENESIS 49:8-12&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Genesis 49:8–12&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; “Judah, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father’s sons will bow down to you. 9 You are a lion’s cub, Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse him? 10 The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his. 11 He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. 12 His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What five blessings was Judah promised?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v. 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v. 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v.9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v.10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v. 11-12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In verse 9 Judah is spoken of as a lion: “You are a lion’s cub, O Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness    who dares to rouse him?” What is signified by this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a scepter (“the scepter will not depart from Judah”)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who were some of the kings that were descended from Judah?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we believe that this section is a Messianic prophecy? (see Revelation 5:5 and Revelation 19:15-16)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So what do we now know about the Messiah?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-star-out-of-jacob---numbers-2415-19&#34;&gt;A STAR OUT OF JACOB - NUMBERS 24:15-19&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Numbers 24:15–19&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; Then he spoke his message: “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly, 16 the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: 17 “I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the people of Sheth. 18 Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong. 19 A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who was Balaam, and when did he utter this prophecy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In his fourth oracle, Balaam said that the Lord led him to see someone who would come “not now” (v.17) but sometime in the future. How was this person described in Balaam’s vision (verses 17-19)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who was Balaam referring to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-star-and-the-ruler&#34;&gt;THE STAR AND THE RULER&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did these men know about the birth of a new king in Israel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did those magi (star observers) want to come and worship this particular Jewish king?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who was Peter talking about when he wrote of the “morning star?” (Revelation 22:16)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-prophet-like-moses---deuteronomy-1815-19&#34;&gt;A PROPHET LIKE MOSES - DEUTERONOMY 18:15-19&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Deuteronomy 18:15–19&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him. 16 For this is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.” 17 The LORD said to me: “What they say is good. 18 I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him. 19 I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know that this passage was a reference to Jesus? (see Acts 3:19-22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moses said that the Prophet would be “like me.” How was Jesus like Moses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Courses: LESSON 5 - THE MESSIAH IN ISAIAH PART 1</title>
      <link>/en/courses/107/5/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-in-the-prophets&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE PROPHETS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be four lessons on the Messianic prophecies in the writings of the prophets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 5 = The Messiah in Isaiah Part 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 6 = The Messiah in Isaiah Part 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 7 = The Messiah In the Major Prophets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 8 = The Messiah in the Minor Prophets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can identify at least 18 Messianic prophecies in Isaiah:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 2:1-5 = The Messiah as the refuge of the people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 4:2 = The Messiah is the Branch of the Lord&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 7:14 = The Messiah is born of a virgin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 8:17-18 = The Messiah trusts in God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 9:1-7 = The Messiah is the heir to the throne of David&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 11:1-5 = The Messiah as the stump from Jesse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 24:21-26 = The triumph of the Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 28:16 = The Messiah as the precious cornerstone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 30:19-26 = The Messiah as teacher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 40:11 = The Messiah as the Good Shepherd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 42:1-7 = The Messiah’s ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 49:1-9 = The Messiah as the light for the Gentiles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 50:4-11 = The Messiah is rejected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 52:13-53:12 = The Messiah as suffering Servant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 55:3-5 = The Messiah’s unfailing gifts promised to David&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 59:16 = The Messiah completes the mission alone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 61:1-2 = The Messiah proclaims good news&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 63:1-6 = The Messiah as conqueror&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE VIRGIN’S SON - ISAIAH 7:11-14&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Isaiah 7:11–14&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; “Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.” 12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test.” 13 Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was the Lord speaking to in these verses? (verse 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the historical background of these verses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would be the consequences if the kings of Syria and Samaria were successful in this plot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ahaz is inspecting the water supply, probably in preparation for a siege, what does the Lord, through Isaiah, tell him is the only real solution to the crisis in Isaiah 7:9?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, what did King Ahaz regard as the solution to his problem? See 2 Kings 16:7-9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the Lord offer a sign to the people of Judah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did Isaiah tell king Ahaz that his refusal to ask for a sign was “trying the patience of the Lord” (verse 13)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of the Hebrew word “almah” (virgin)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we now know about the Messiah from this prophecy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the doctrine of the virgin birth an essential part of the Christian faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;light-for-the-gentiles--isaiah-91-7&#34;&gt;LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES – ISAIAH 9:1-7&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Isaiah 9:1–7&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan— 2 The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned. 3 You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as warriors rejoice when dividing the plunder. 4 For as in the day of Midian’s defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor. 5 Every warrior’s boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire. 6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 7 Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are Zebulon and Naphtali?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why will the inhabitants of Zebulon and Naphtali no longer be gloomy, but filled with joy (verse 3)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What four names are given to the Messiah in verse 6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will Messiah’s reign be like according to verse 7?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 4:12-17, 23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Matthew 4:12–17&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. 13 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali—14 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: 15 “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles— 16 the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.” 17 From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Matthew 4:23&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;15&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from the prophecy of Isaiah 9:1-7?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-root-of-jesse--isaiah-111-10&#34;&gt;THE ROOT OF JESSE – ISAIAH 11:1-10&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Isaiah 11:1–10&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. 2 The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him— the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the LORD— 3 and he will delight in the fear of the LORD. He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears; 4 but with righteousness he will judge the needy, with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked. 5 Righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist. 6 The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. 7 The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. 8 The infant will play near the cobra’s den, the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest. 9 They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea. 10 In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 1 says that Jesse’s tree has been cut down, leaving only a stump. When did this take place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 1 talks about someone that it calls “a shoot” or a “Branch” and a “Root of Jesse.” Who is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the prophecy describe the Branch from Jesse’s tree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the significance of the belt or sash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the prophet says that this will be the situation on “my holy mountain.” What mountain is he referring to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the message of this picture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the “banner” that will stand as the rallying point for people of every nation? (See John 12:31-33)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this section?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-in-the-prophets&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE PROPHETS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be four lessons on the Messianic prophecies in the writings of the prophets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 5 = The Messiah in Isaiah Part 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 6 = The Messiah in Isaiah Part 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 7 = The Messiah In the Major Prophets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 8 = The Messiah in the Minor Prophets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson we will select two of the Messianic prophecies in the last half of Isaiah:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 40:11 = The Messiah as the Good Shepherd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 42:1-7 = The Messiah’s ministry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 49:1-9 = The Messiah as the light for the Gentiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 50:4-11 = The Messiah is rejected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 52:13-53:12 = The Messiah as suffering Servant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 55:3-5 = The Messiah’s unfailing gifts promised to David&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 59:16 = The Messiah completes the mission alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 61:1-2 = The Messiah proclaims good news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 63:1-6 = The Messiah as conqueror&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiahs-ministry---isaiah-421-7&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH’S MINISTRY - ISAIAH 42:1-7&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Isaiah 42:1–7&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; “Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations. 2 He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. 3 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; 4 he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope.” 5 This is what God the LORD says— the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it: 6 “I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, 7 to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term “servant of the Lord” is used to refer to many different people in the Bible. Look at these passages and identify “the servant of the Lord.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 26:24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deuteronomy 34:5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Samuel 7:8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke 1:38&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James 1:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 41:8-9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is being called “God’s servant” in Isaiah 42:1-7? See Matthew 12:15-21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agree or disagree: To be a “servant of the Lord” does not imply inferior status or lesser importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament identifies Jesus as a “servant.” How was Jesus the Lord’s servant in these verses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Jesus Christ] made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death— even death on a cross!” (Philippians 2:7–8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.” (Acts 3:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point out words and phrases in these verses (42:1-7) that indicate the Messiah was not coming only to help and save the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agree or disagree: Each of us is a servant of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What special mission or task has God chosen us for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this prophecy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-suffering-servant----isaiah-5213-5312&#34;&gt;THE SUFFERING SERVANT -  ISAIAH 52:13-53:12&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Isaiah 52:13–53:12&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted. 14 Just as there were many who were appalled at him— his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his form marred beyond human likeness— 15 so he will sprinkle many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand. 53:1 Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? 2 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. 3 He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. 4 Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. 6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. 7 He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. 8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished. 9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. 10 Yet it was the LORD’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. 11 After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. 12 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the phrase “so will he sprinkle many nations” (v.15) teach us? (See Hebrews 9:19-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a few examples of occasions when Jesus “was despised and rejected by men” (verse 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the phrase “yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted” (verse 4) mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this verse, what was the main mission for which this Servant was chosen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read the phrase, “he was led like a lamb to the slaughter” what Biblical picture comes to mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 53:9 reads: “He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death.” Describe how this was fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Isaiah 53:10 what is the lesson of these words: “Yet it was the LORD’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer … the LORD makes his life a guilt offering”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Isaiah 53:10-11 the prophecy says: “he will see his offspring and prolong his days. After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied.” What truth is being taught in these phrases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last half of verse 11 reads: “by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.” What does the phrase “by his knowledge” mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this prophecy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the end of our study of the Messianic prophecies in the prophet Isaiah. Next week we will look at some of the most important Messianic prophecies in the Major prophets.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-in-the-major-prophets&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE MAJOR PROPHETS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 23:5-6 = The Lord our Righteousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 30:9,21 = The Messiah as the priestly king&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 31:15 = The massacre of infants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 33:15-16 = The Lord Our Righteousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel 17:22-24 = The Messiah as the tender sprig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel 21:25-27 = The Messiah as the rightful king&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel 34:11-16, 23, 24 = The Messiah as Good Shepherd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel 37:15-28 = The Messiah as the great unifier of nations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel 7:13-14 = The Son of Man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel 9:24-27 = The Messiah as anointed ruler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS – JEREMIAH 23:5-6&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Jeremiah 23:5–6&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; “The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land. 6 In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The LORD Our Righteous Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did Jeremiah write these words?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other verses in Jeremiah are almost exactly the same as these verses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do the first words of this prophecy, “The days are coming” (23:5) indicate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What “Branch” is the prophet writing about with the words, “I will raise up to David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name some people, other than Jesus, who are “righteous”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though all these people are called “righteous”, are they righteous people because they have lived a perfect life? (see Psalm 51:5; Psalm 143:2; Job 25:4; Ecclesiastes 7:20; Isaiah 64:6; Romans 3:10; Romans 3:23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How were they righteous? (see Hebrews 11:4; Hebrews 11:7; Galatians 3:6; Hebrews 11:31; Romans 4:6; Habakkuk 2:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the two ways in which the Bible uses the terms “righteous” and “righteousness”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe the LAW usage of the terms “righteous” and “righteousness”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe the GOSPEL usage of the terms “righteous” and “righteousness”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Messiah called in verse 6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the way of righteousness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we now know about the Messiah from this prophecy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE SON OF MAN -  DANIEL 7:13-14&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Daniel 7:13–14&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. 14 He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 9 the “Ancient of Days,” seated on the throne, is introduced. Who is this? (see 7:9 and 7:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his night vision Daniel sees “one like a son of man.” Literally, the phrase is “one like the son of a human being.” Who is this? See John 9:35-37.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this prophecy, how will the Son of Man come to us? (see also Matthew 24:30; Matthews 26:65)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will the Messiah’s kingdom be like according to this prophecy? (see also Matthew 28:18; Revelation 7:9,11; Philippians 2:9-11; Luke 1:32-33)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this prophecy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week we will look at some of the most important Messianic prophecies in the “minor” prophetic books.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-in-the-minor-prophets&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE MINOR PROPHETS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By “minor prophets” we do not mean that these prophets were of less importance or less powerful than the so-called major prophets. Rather we mean that these prophetical books of the Old Testament are shorter in length than the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROPHETIC PERSPECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/course-file/107/107-8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PROPHETIC PERSPECTIVE&#34; title=&#34;PROPHETIC PERSPECTIVE&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drawing is an attempt to represent how, from the prophet’s perspective, both comings of the Messiah were seen as one. The prophet could not see that there were many years between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MESSIAH KING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  – ZECHARIAH 9:9-10&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Zechariah 9:9–10&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. 10 I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the warhorses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 9 the prophet names the “Daughter of Zion” and the “Daughter of Jerusalem”. Who are these daughters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 9 says that Jerusalem’s king is coming to them. Who is this king?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 9 says that “your king comes to you”. Point out how these words are a proclamation of the GOSPEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the phrase “having salvation” mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this Messiah-King comes how will he be “gentle”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would the Messiah ride on a donkey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 10 what will the Messiah “take away” (eliminate)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this humble King comes, what will be his message to the people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be the extent of the rule of this Messiah King?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we now know about the Messiah from this prophecy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messenger-of-the-covenant---malachi-31-4&#34;&gt;THE MESSENGER OF THE COVENANT - MALACHI 3:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;bible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;Malachi 3:1–4&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;font-weight-bold&#34;&gt; “I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,” says the LORD Almighty. 2 But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s soap. 3 He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the LORD will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness, 4 and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the LORD, as in days gone by, as in former years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small class=&#34;text-muted float-right mt-n3&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;i&gt;The New International Version.&lt;/i&gt; 2011.
        &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the speaker in verse 1?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the “my messenger” (the Lord’s messenger”) in verse 1? (See Matthew 11:7-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would this messenger do? How would he do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 1 who is the second messenger, “the messenger of the covenant”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What covenant would this messenger proclaim and establish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 1 we are told that the Messiah will come “suddenly”. (“suddenly the messenger of the covenant… will come”) How was the Messiah’s first coming “sudden”? How will the Messiah’s 2nd coming be “sudden”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 1 the prophet says that the Messiah will come to “his temple”. (“the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple”) What temple is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 2 refers to a “day of his coming.” Is this a warning of a day of judgment or a promise of a day of cleansing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the purpose of all the refining and cleansing according to verses 3-4?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this prophecy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This concludes our study of the Messiah in the Prophets. Next week we will turn to the Old Testament section called “the Psalms” to begin exploring some of those prophecies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE WRITINGS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” (Luke 24:44–45)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm section of the Hebrew Old Testament actually includes more than just the book of Psalms: Job, Ruth, 1 &amp;amp; 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and Lamentations. This third section is sometimes called “the Writings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 9 = The Messiah Does God’s Will (Psalm 40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 10 = The Messiah is Crucified (Psalm 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 11 = The Messiah is the Risen Lord (Psalm 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 12 = The Messiah is the King of Glory (Psalms 2 and 110)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIRECT AND INDIRECT MESSIANIC PROPHECY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct Messianic prophecy. This is when the prophecy has only one possible fulfillment in Christ. Prophecy &amp;mdash;&amp;gt; Christ  Examples: the virgin birth in Isaiah 7:14 or Christ’s resurrection in Psalm 16:10 “You will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your holy one see decay.” Those prophecies can be referring to no one other than Jesus. 
Indirect Messianic prophecy.  This is when the passage may be about two future events – an early partial or incomplete fulfillment (an event or person) and the ultimate, final, greater fulfillment in Christ. Prophecy &amp;mdash;&amp;gt; Type &amp;mdash;&amp;gt; Christ.  Example: David will have a son who will build God’s house (2 Samuel 7:1-16). Solomon is the intermediate fulfillment, but the great fulfillment is in Christ (Prophet 🡪 Solomon 🡪 Christ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MESSIAH IN PSALM 40&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require. 7 Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll. 8 I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.” (Psalm 40:6-8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 40:6-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 10:5-6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; 6 with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll. 8 I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.”
“Then I said, ‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll— I have come to do your will, O God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wrote Psalm 40 according to the superscription?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to verse 6, what was not pleasing to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was not pleasing about those things? Didn’t God specify that they should be done in the laws of Moses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of the phrase “my ears you have pierced” in verse 6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What scroll is this in verse 7? Is this the scroll of the Torah (the Law of Moses in the first 5 books of the Old Testament) or the entire Old Testament?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of “your law is within my heart” in verse 8?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about verse 12? Doesn’t that verse apply to someone other than the Messiah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this Psalm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week we will continue to look at the amazing Messianic psalms. We will focus on Psalm 22, sometimes called “the Holy of Holies of the Messianic psalms.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE WRITINGS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” (Luke 24:44–45)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 9 = The Messiah Does God’s Will (Psalm 40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 10 = The Messiah is Crucified (Psalm 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 11 = The Messiah is the Risen Lord (Psalm 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 12 = The Messiah is the King of Glory (Psalms 2 and 110)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MESSIAH IN PSALM 22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vv. 1-21 = The Messiah’s lament over his extraordinary suffering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vv. 22-31 = The Savior’s hymn of praise for his deliverance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this psalm we find six amazing details related to Jesus’ suffering and death on Good Friday. Fill in the blanks below with those amazing details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 1 &amp;ndash; cp. Matthew 27:46 __________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 22:1 &amp;ndash; My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 27:46 &amp;ndash; About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”—which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 7 &amp;ndash; cp. Matthew 27:39 ___________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 22:7 &amp;ndash; All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 27:39 &amp;ndash; Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 11 &amp;ndash; cp. Matthew 26:56 __________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 22:11 &amp;ndash; Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 26:56 &amp;ndash; But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 15 &amp;ndash; cp. John 19:28 __________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 22:15 &amp;ndash; My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 19:28 &amp;ndash; Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 16 &amp;ndash; cp. John 19:34 ____________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 22:16 &amp;ndash; Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 23:33 &amp;ndash; When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 18 &amp;ndash; cp. Matthew 27:35 ________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 22:18 &amp;ndash; They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 27:35 &amp;ndash; When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This psalm, recorded a thousand years before the events occurred, contains detailed prophecies that were fulfilled exactly. What do all these amazing details of prophecy tell us about the passion of Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was actually speaking through David’s inspired pen? Before you answer, compare Psalm 22:22 with Hebrews 2:11-12,14.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning? 2 O my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you answer Jesus’ question in verse 1? Why was He forsaken, and why was the Father so far from Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says that he was calling out “by day” and “by night”. When was it that Jesus prayed this – day or night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the praise of Israel. 4 In you our fathers put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them. 5 They cried to you and were saved; in you they trusted and were not disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Jesus recalls how God never forsook His people in the Old Testament, even when their iniquity was great. Can you think of some examples of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people. 7 All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads: 8 “He trusts in the Lord; let the Lord rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.” 9 Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother’s breast. 10 From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother’s womb you have been my God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What must have been especially painful about the mocking and tainting that Jesus had to endure at the cross?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help. 12 Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me. 13 Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me. 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death. 16 Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet. 17 I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me. 18 They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 But you, O Lord, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me. 20 Deliver my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs. 21 Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; save me from the horns of the wild oxen.
Why does Jesus say that life is “precious”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 I will declare your name to my brothers; in the congregation I will praise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the speaker (“I”) in this verse? See Hebrews 2:11-12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Jesus call us in this verse? Why is that a comfort to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 You who fear the Lord, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel! 24 For he has not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help. 25 From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear you will I fulfill my vows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Jesus encourage us to do in verses 23 and 25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the “afflicted one” in verse 24?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be “the theme of my praise in the great assembly?” (verse 25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 The poor will eat and be satisfied; they who seek the Lord will praise him— may your hearts live forever! 27 All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him, 28 for dominion belongs to the Lord and he rules over the nations. 29 All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him— those who cannot keep themselves alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What phrases in these verses emphasize that all people will praise the Lord for what the Messiah has done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What great truth do the last words of verse 29 contain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord. 31 They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn— for he has done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the “They” in verse 31 who will proclaim the Savior’s righteousness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this Psalm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week we will continue to look at the amazing Messianic psalms. We will focus on Psalm 16 which proclaims that the Messiah will rise from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE PSALMS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” (Luke 24:44–45)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 9 = The Messiah Does God’s Will (Psalm 40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 10 = The Messiah is Crucified (Psalm 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 11 = The Messiah is the Risen Lord (Psalm 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 12 = The Messiah is the King of Glory (Psalms 2 and 110)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNDERSTANDING THIS PSALM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What event does do both Peter and Paul say is prophesied about the Messiah in Psalm 16?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PART 1 – JESUS’ PERFECT OBEDIENCE AND SUBMISSION TO THE FATHER’S WILL (vv 1-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:1-2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep me safe, O God, for in you I take refuge. 2 I said to the Lord, “You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What being requested in this prayer (v.1)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What thought or idea was Jesus expressing in this prayer in verse 1?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think “apart from you I have no good thing” (verse 2) means?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this saying that all our blessings come from God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this saying that nothing I do is good unless it is done for the glory of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this apply to us? Which of these statements would be an application of this verse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.” (James 1:17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Praise God from whom all blessings flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not my will, but Thine be done. Lord, Your will for my life is always best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the saints who are in the land, they are the glorious ones in whom is all my delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are the “saints in the land” in verse 3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are the saints “glorious ones” (verse 3)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the recipients of glorious grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do everything for the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have their identity in Christ, who is glorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Jesus show us that He takes delight in us (verse 3)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorrows of those will increase who run after other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood or take up their names on my lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is meant by“libations of blood” in verse 4?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Messiah (Jesus) expressing with these words?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PART 2 - JESUS EXPRESSES CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE (vv 5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, you have assigned me my portion and my cup; you have made my lot secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the “the cup” (verse 5) that the Father had assigned to Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was “the portion” (verse 5) that God had assigned to the Messiah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the idea behind “boundary lines” in verse 6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PART 3 – JESUS CONFIDENCE THAT THE LORD IS WITH HIM (v 7-8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will praise the Lord, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the Lord “counsel and instruct” us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have set the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean that the Messiah has “set the Lord always before me”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PART 4 - JESUS WILL RISE FROM THE DEAD AND LIVE FOREVER (V.9-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:9-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure, because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 9 Jesus says that he “is glad and that He rests secure”. What is it that gives him joy and security?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can we be glad and secure even in the face of death?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 16:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the Messiah confesses that the Father has made “the path of life” known to him. What is the “path of life”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Jesus foretelling with the words “joy in your presence, eternal pleasures at your right hand”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this Psalm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week we will complete our study of the Messiah in the Old Testament as we examine two wonderful psalms (Psalm 2 and Psalm 110) which proclaim the Messiah’s ultimate victory and rule over all things.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-messiah-in-the-psalms&#34;&gt;THE MESSIAH IN THE PSALMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” (Luke 24:44–45)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 9 = The Messiah Does God’s Will (Psalm 40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 10 = The Messiah is Crucified (Psalm 22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 11 = The Messiah is the Risen Lord (Psalm 16)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 12 = The Messiah is the King of Glory (Psalms 2 and 110)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;psalm-2&#34;&gt;PSALM 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many Psalms have superscriptions that identify the human author. But Psalm 2 has no superscription. Nevertheless, we may know who the human author is. Read Acts 4:23-29. According to Peter in this inspired account, who is the human author of Psalm 2?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REBELLION AGAINST GOD’S ANOINTED KING (v. 1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain? 
2The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against his Anointed One. 
3“Let us break their chains,” they say, “and throw off their fetters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the “Anointed One” of verse 2? (See Acts 4:25-28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These verses speak of people who conspire and plot against the Lord and his Messiah. The rebels include “kings of the earth” and “rulers.” Who are these people? See Acts 4:5,6,27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people rebel against the Lord they are also rebelling against the Anointed One (see John 10:30 – “I and the Father are one.”) In verse 1 the psalmist asks “why” those people were plotting and rebelling against the Lord’s Messiah? Can you give any reasons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOD’S ANGRY REBUKE OF THE REBELLIOUS (v.4-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them. 
5Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, 
6“I have installed my King on Zion, my holy hill.”
5)	What is comforting about the fact that God laughs and scoffs at the efforts to oppose his work? (verse 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What effect will God’s reply have on those who rebel (verse 5)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE RULE OF THE ANOINTED ONE (v.7-9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7I will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father. 
8Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. 
9You will rule them with an iron scepter; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is “the Son” referred to in verse 7? See Acts 13:32-33; Hebrews 1:5; Hebrews 5:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 7 the Father says, “today I have become your Father.” What day is “today”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the “iron scepter” in verse 9?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE ADMONITION TO US ALL (v.10-12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth. 
11Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling. 
12Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him. 
10)	In verse 12 we are advised to “kiss the Son.” What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this psalm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSALM 110&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: “Of David. A psalm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who wrote Psalm 110?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERSE 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1The LORD says to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the second “my Lord” in verse 1?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who does Peter identify as the “Lord of David” (Acts 2:29-36)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to “sit at the right hand” (verse 1)? (see Ephesians 1:20-21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean that “your enemies are a footstool for your feet”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERSE 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from Zion, saying, “Rule in the midst of your enemies!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERSE 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, your young men will come to you like dew from the morning’s womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While verse 2 speaks of Jesus’ enemies submitting, this verse speaks of the willing submission of the Messiah’s “troops.” Who are the “troops”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the “day of battle”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERSE 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prophecy is in the form of an oath. By swearing an oath, what is the Lord indicating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 3 the Messiah was said to be a king. But now in this prophecy there is a new piece of information about the Messiah. In verse 4 this “Lord of David” is said to be a _________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was this so unusual and strange for the Messiah to be both a King and a Priest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is Melchizedek? (see Genesis 14:17–20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERSES 5-6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath. 6He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;23&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What day is being prophesied in these verses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERSE 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7He will drink from a brook along the way, and so he will lift his head high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;24&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we learn about the Messiah from this Psalm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
