<p>THE VIRGIN’S SON - ISAIAH 7:11-14</p>



<div class="bible">
    <div class="h6">Isaiah 7:11–14</div>
    <p class="font-weight-bold"> “Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.” 12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test.” 13 Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.</p>

<li>
<p>Who was the Lord speaking to in these verses? (verse 13)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was the historical background of these verses?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would be the consequences if the kings of Syria and Samaria were successful in this plot?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Ahaz is inspecting the water supply, probably in preparation for a siege, what does the Lord, through Isaiah, tell him is the only real solution to the crisis in Isaiah 7:9?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nevertheless, what did King Ahaz regard as the solution to his problem? See 2 Kings 16:7-9</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the Lord offer a sign to the people of Judah?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did Isaiah tell king Ahaz that his refusal to ask for a sign was “trying the patience of the Lord” (verse 13)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the meaning of the Hebrew word “almah” (virgin)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So what do we now know about the Messiah from this prophecy?</p>

<li>
<p>Why is the doctrine of the virgin birth an essential part of the Christian faith?</p>

<div class="bible">
    <div class="h6">Isaiah 9:1–7</div>
    <p class="font-weight-bold"> Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan— 2 The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned. 3 You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as warriors rejoice when dividing the plunder. 4 For as in the day of Midian’s defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor. 5 Every warrior’s boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire. 6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 7 Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold"> When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. 13 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali—14 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: 15 “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles— 16 the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.” 17 From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”</p>

He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears; 4 but with righteousness he will judge the needy, with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked. 5 Righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist. 6 The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. 7 The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. 8 The infant will play near the cobra’s den, the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest. 9 They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea. 10 In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious.</p>
