<h2 id="introduction-简介">INTRODUCTION 简介</h2>
<p>Jesus spent Tuesday morning of Holy Week in the temple. There he condemned the Jewish leaders. Two days later these same men would have Jesus arrested and on Friday put him to death.  In these last days Jesus continued educating the disciples by his words and his actions. Most importantly he left his church with a visible reminder of his love and salvation – the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>耶稣在圣殿中渡过了圣周星期四的早晨。他在那里斥责了犹太的领袖们。两天后就是他们逮捕了耶稣，并在星期五将他处死。在这最后的几天里，耶稣继续用话语和行动教导他的门徒们。。更重要的是，他为他的教会留下了一个可见的提醒——关于爱和救恩的提醒——主的晚餐。</p>
<p><strong>Signs of the end of the age &ndash; Luke 21:5-36   Matthew 24 &amp; 25   Mark 13</strong></p>
<p><strong>末世的预兆 &ndash; 路加福音21：5-36  马太福音24 &amp; 25  马可福音13</strong></p>
<p>The Lord of the temple left the temple for the last time in the middle of a huge dispute.  His disappointed disciples tried to see the brighter side. “Look, Teacher! What huge stones! What impressive buildings!” (Mark 13:1).</p>
<p>在一阵嘈杂声中，圣殿的主最后一次从圣殿中离开。他失望的门徒们试图看到积极的一面。“看啊，老师！多么巨大的石块！多么令人钦佩的建筑！（马可福音13:1）”。</p>
<p>The Jewish historian Josephus described the temple in detail.  Some stones were 40 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 20 feet high. The beautiful building had white marble pillars and silver and gold doors. Jesus, however, could see the false teaching that took place around the temple.  He predicted its total destruction. Later, Jesus and his disciples stopped on the Mount of Olives and looked back at the temple across the valley.  The disciples then asked when the temple would be left deserted. They also wondered when the world would come to an end.</p>
<p>犹太的历史学教约瑟夫详细地描述了圣殿。一些石头有40英尺长，14英尺宽，20英尺高。这些美妙的建筑有着白色大理石的柱子，和金银制造的门。然而，耶稣能够看到圣殿周围所发生的错误教导。他预言圣殿将完全毁灭。稍后，耶稣和他的门徒们在橄榄山顶停留，隔着峡谷回望圣殿。门徒们随即问耶稣圣殿何时被遗弃。他们也很好奇世界末日的样子。</p>
<p>Jesus was not willing to give the exact times.  Indeed, in his state of humiliation, Jesus said that even he did not know (Matthew 24:36).  But he did give them signs which would show when the end was near.  It is almost as if Jesus looked at the hills and valleys and could see their destruction. Then his eyes saw the temple which would be destroyed. Finally, he looked off again into the distance.</p>
<p>耶稣不愿说出准确的时候。实际上他谦卑地宣称，这一点连他自己也不知道（马太福音24:36）。但是耶稣确实给了他们世界末日即将到来的征兆。这就好像是说，耶稣注视着这些山脉，注视着眼前的峡谷，他看到了他们的毁灭。随即他的眼睛又看到了将要毁灭的圣殿。最后他望向远方。</p>
<p>For the most part, Matthew 24:4-14 describes the Last Days at the end of the world. Before Judgment Day there will be crises in the church (false christs, persecutions, a falling away from the true faith), in nature (famines, earthquakes) and in society (wars and rumors of war).  Meanwhile, Matthew 24:15-28 speaks mostly of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple.  Forty years later, in April of A.D. 70, the Roman emperor Titus attacked Jerusalem. By August the city was destroyed and the temple was burned.  Before this happened, however, many of the Christians in Jerusalem fled and found refuge in Pella, a city east of the Jordan.  Finally, in Matthew 24:29-31 Jesus’ thoughts returned to Judgment Day and his own glorious return.</p>
<p>在很大程度上，马太福音24:4-1节经文描述了世界结束时的日子。在审判日来临之前，教会（假基督，逼迫，失去真信心而跌倒）、自然（饥荒、地震）和社会（战争和战乱的谣言）将面临各样的危机。那时候，马太福音24:15-28中主要提到了耶路撒冷和圣殿的毁灭。四十年之后，在公元70年的四月份，罗马皇帝提图斯（Titus）围困了耶路撒冷。8月份城市就沦陷了，圣殿也被焚毁。然而在这一切发生之前，很多耶路撒冷的基督徒就逃走了，并且在约旦东部的一个城市佩拉（Pella）找到了藏身之所。最后，在马太福音24:29-31节，耶稣的思绪回到了末日审判和他自己荣耀再临的上面。</p>
<p>Jesus pointed out that believers must always be alert and use their lives wisely.  The parables of the Thief in the Night, the Faithful and Evil Servants, the Ten Virgins, and the Talents all describe these truths.</p>
<p>耶稣指出，信徒们必须常常警醒，并且智慧地度过他们的年日。盗贼和夜晚的比喻，忠心的仆人和恶仆，十个童女，和才干的比喻都是在形容这些真相。</p>
<p>The local shepherds grazed their sheep and goats together by day, but separated them at night.  Jesus used this picture to describe Judgment Day.  He, as Judge, King, and Shepherd, will on that day separate the believers who proved their love for him by their works (the sheep) from unbelievers (the goats). The believers will be received into heaven, while the unbelievers will be sent to hell.</p>
<p>当地的牧羊人白天会将绵羊和山羊放在一起牧养，到了晚上，就把它们分开。耶稣用这个场景描绘末日的审判。作为审判者，国王和牧者，在那一天到来的时候，信徒们（绵羊）的行为表明了他们对耶稣的爱，耶稣因此将他们与不信的人（山羊）分别开来。信徒们会被接到天上，不信的人会被送入地狱。</p>
<p><strong>The plot to kill Jesus &ndash; Luke 21:37-38; 22:1-6</strong></p>
<p><strong>杀害耶稣的阴谋 &ndash; 路加福音21：37-38，22：1-6</strong></p>
<p>Earlier that day Jesus, the “Light” of the world, had shown his enemies to be the children of darkness (see the “woes” discussed in the last chapter). Darkness cannot tolerate the Light, so the rulers sought to put out the true Light, Jesus.  However, since the Jewish leaders were aware how popular Jesus was, they were prepared to wait until the Passover festival was over before arresting him. God had a different plan, however.  Jesus predicted that in two days he would be betrayed and soon face death.</p>
<p>那一天的早些时候，作为世界的“光”，耶稣已经表明他的敌人们是黑暗之子（参看在上一章中讨论过的那些“祸”）。黑暗不能忍受光，所以那些官长企图消灭真光耶稣。不过，这些犹太的领袖们意识到耶稣是多么的受欢迎，因此他们准备继续等待，直到逾越节过去之后再逮捕他。然而，上帝有不一样的的计划。耶稣预示两天内他将要被出卖，不久之后将面对死亡。</p>
<p>While Christ and 11 of the disciples spent Tuesday night outside the city (Luke 21:37-38), Judas found an excuse to go into Jerusalem. There he sold his Lord and his soul for 30 pieces of silver.</p>
<p>当基督和是一个门徒在城外共度星期四的夜晚时（路加福音21:37-38），犹大找了一个借口，回到了耶路撒冷。在那里他因30块钱，将他的主和自己的灵魂出卖了。</p>
<p>What happened inside Judas? Some people say that, like the other disciples, Judas failed to understand the nature of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.  As Jesus got less popular, his disciples’ hopes were smashed. Finally Judas decided to get out while he could, hopefully with a few dollars to his name.</p>
<p>犹大的内心发生了怎样的变化？有人认为，和其他的门徒一样，犹大错误地理解了基督国度的性质。当耶稣不再那么受欢迎时，门徒们的希望也破灭了。最后，犹大决定在可以的时候离开，希望自己至少可以得到一点钱财。</p>
<p>While this may be correct, the Bible points out only one weakness in Judas – the love of money or greed (John 12:6; Matthew 26:15).   This spiritual sickness grew in Judas until Satan took complete control of his soul.  Satan usually finds the believer’s weakest spiritual link and attacks in that area.</p>
<p>很可能就是这样，圣经指出犹大唯一的软弱——贪爱钱财（约翰福音12:6；马太福音26:15）。这个属灵的病毒在犹大生命中扩散，直到撒旦完全地掌管了他的灵魂。撒旦通常找到信徒们灵里最软弱的环节，并就此展开攻击。</p>
<p>The 30 silver coins which Judas received amounted to 120 days’ wages. The Scriptures were fulfilled (Zechariah 11:12-13; Ps. 41:9).</p>
<p>犹大所收的30块钱相当于120天的工资。这也印证了圣经的预言（撒加利亚书11:12-13；诗篇41:9）。</p>
<h2 id="wednesday-of-holy-week-圣周的星期三">Wednesday of Holy Week 圣周的星期三</h2>
<p>If the day we studied in Chapter 5 was Jesus’ busiest, then Tuesday of Holy Week must have been a close second. Wednesday, however, was a quiet day of teaching and prayer, a divine calm before the storm.  The Bible does not mention any events of this day.</p>
<p>如果我们在第五章中学习的是耶稣最忙碌的一天，那么圣周星期二的忙碌可以说紧随其后。然而星期三是安静的一天，只有教导和祷告，像是风暴到来前一样完美的平静。圣经没有提到任何有关这一天的事情。</p>
<h2 id="thursday-of-holy-week-圣周星期四">Thursday of Holy Week 圣周星期四</h2>
<p><strong>The Passover Celebration 庆祝逾越节</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peter &amp; John prepare the room &ndash; Luke 22:7-13</strong></p>
<p><strong>彼得和约翰预备过节的房间 &ndash; 路加福音22：7-13</strong></p>
<p>Jesus and the disciples spent Wednesday night in Bethany.  The next morning the disciples began thinking about where they would eat the Passover meal.  Jesus told Peter and John where to go and what to do.  In Jerusalem they would find a man carrying water.  This would be unusual because carrying water was women’s work.  This man would show them a house where they could prepare the Passover meal.</p>
<p>耶稣和门徒们在伯大尼度过了星期三的夜晚。第二天早晨，门徒们开始考虑将在哪里吃逾越节的晚宴。耶稣告诉彼得和约翰该去哪里以及该怎样行。在耶路撒冷他们将要看到一个去打水的男人。这是很奇怪的，因为打水是女人的事情。这个男人将会带他们去看一个房子，在那里他们可以预备逾越节的晚宴。</p>
<p>What was Jesus thinking about on that Thursday?  He knew his time had come.  Recall that on Tuesday he had prophesied, “As you know, the Passover is two days away and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified” (Matthew 26:2). Jesus was to be handed over on the Passover day.  Some 1476 years earlier the Children of Israel had been slaves in Egypt. When a series of plagues could not persuade the Egyptian pharaoh to release the Israelites, God sent to earth an angel of death.</p>
<p>在那个星期四耶稣在想哪些事情呢？他知道他的时间到了。回顾他在星期二所预言的：“你们知道，过两天是逾越节，人子将要被交给人，钉在十字架上。（马太福音26:2）”。逾越节这天，耶稣将要被交给人。大约1476年前，以色列的子孙们在埃及为奴。当一系列的灾难也不能让埃及法老释放以色列人离开的时候，上帝派遣了一个死亡的天使来到世间。</p>
<p>The story is told in detail in Exodus 12:  On the tenth day of the month the Jews selected perfect lambs (normal and healthy). Four days later (when the moon was full) they killed the lambs and put the blood on their doors. The meal that night (now the 15th day, since for the Jews evening marked the beginning of a new day) was the roasted lamb and bread without yeast. That night the angel of death passed over the houses marked with blood, but stopped at the others.  The angel killed the oldest son in each of the houses where there was no blood marking the door. After this the Israelites were set free.  From then on the Passover was celebrated to remember how God had saved them.</p>
<p>这个故事的细节记载在出埃及记12章中：在本月初十日，犹太人选择了完美的羔羊（正常并且健康）。四天之后（这天是满月），他们宰杀了羔羊，然后把它的血涂抹在门框门楣上。当夜（初十五日，因为犹太人的傍晚是一天的开始）要吃烤羊肉和无酵饼。那一夜死亡的天使会越过那些门上涂着血的房屋，而停在其他（门楣上没有血）的房屋前，击杀了那些屋中的长子。此后以色列人得着自由。从那时起，他们在逾越节这天庆祝并纪念上帝如何拯救了他们。</p>
<p>On Palm Sunday, the tenth day of the Jewish month, Jesus rode into Jerusalem to give himself as the sinless lamb of God.  Now, four days later (Wednesday sundown to Thursday sundown), Jesus was prepared to offer himself as the Passover sacrifice.  Through his blood the world would be freed from the slavery of sin (see 1 Peter 1:19).</p>
<p>在棕枝主日，犹太月的第十天，耶稣骑着驴驹进入耶路撒冷，使自己作为上帝无罪的羔羊。现在，四天后（星期三的日落到星期四的日落），耶稣准备好作为逾越节的祭物被献上。通过他的血，世界将会从罪的奴役中得释放（参看彼得前书1:19）。</p>
<h2 id="thursday-evening-good-friday-begins-星期四晚上受难日开始">Thursday Evening (Good Friday begins) 星期四晚上—（受难日开始）</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-简介-1">Introduction 简介</h3>
<p>It was now Friday, April 7, A.D. 30, the day of Jesus’ greatest sufferings, his trials, and his execution on the cross.  We most often refer to this day as Good Friday. It was a good, yes even a great and glorious day for the world.  For it was the day when Christ paid the price for the sins of all mankind and earned salvation for every soul.</p>
<p>时间回到公元30年，4月7日，星期五。在这一天，耶稣要经历伟大的苦难，接受审判，并死在十字架上。我们常常称这天为“受难日”，这一天是美好的，对世界而言甚至是伟大和荣耀的。因为这一天耶稣为全人类的罪付上了代价，并为每一个灵魂带来了拯救。</p>
<p><strong>The disciples argue about which is the greatest &ndash; Luke 22:24-27</strong></p>
<p><strong>门徒们的争论：谁最大 &ndash; 路加福音22：24-27</strong></p>
<p>At dinner time Jesus and his disciples went into the upper room in the Jerusalem home.  There they celebrated the Passover. The famous Leonardo da Vinci painting “The Last Supper” is very beautiful, but it does not picture the scene properly.  The thirteen people did not sit up at a table.  Rather they reclined on their left sides on large couches and ate from a central table or tables. Based on the customs of the day, we can make the following diagram:</p>
<p>到了进餐的时候，耶稣和他的门徒们来到了位于耶路撒冷内的这间房子，进入了楼上的房间。在那里他们要庆祝逾越节。著名的莱奥纳多达芬奇绘制的画作“最后的晚餐”非常的美妙，但是它没有正确地描绘出当时的场景。十三个人不是并排坐在桌子的一边；而是各自向左躺卧在很大的卧榻上，并从中间的一章或几张桌子拿取食物。根据当时的风俗，我们可以绘制成上面这样的图：</p>
<p>The disciples began the evening arguing about which of them was the greatest.  Luke mentions this arguing after he has told us about the sacrament which Jesus established.  (Luke 22:24-27) This is an example of how Luke writes topically, rather than chronologically. Such arguments were often a problem among the disciples (Mark 9:33-34; Matthew 20:20-24).  Jesus handled the matter just like he did a few days earlier (Matthew 20:25-28).  However, Jesus promised the disciples rewards, not for service, but for faithfulness.</p>
<p>当晚，门徒们开始争论他们中间哪一个可算为大。在告诉我们耶稣设立的圣餐后，路加提到了这场争论。（路加福音22：24-27）这是路加按论题而不是按时间顺序写作的一个范例。门徒间经常就这样的问题争执不下（马可福音9:33-34；马太福音20:20-24）。耶稣仍旧如几天前一样处理了这事（马太福音20:25-28）。然而，耶稣应许他的门徒们将会得到奖赏，这奖赏不是因为服事，而是因为他们的忠心。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus washes his disciples’ feet &ndash; John 13:1-17</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣为门徒洗脚 &ndash; 约翰福音13:1-17</strong></p>
<p>Before Jews began to eat the Passover meal a servant or slave would wash their feet. This time Jesus himself rose, took water and towel in hand and began the washing.  He did this out of love and for an example of humility. When he came to Peter, the disciple first refused to let Christ wash his feet.  When Christ told him that this was his will, Peter then demanded even more washing.</p>
<p>在犹太人开始吃逾越节晚餐之前，仆人或奴仆会给他们洗脚。这次耶稣自己站起来，打来水并拿着毛巾，开始为门徒们洗脚。他这样做是出于爱，并且作谦卑的榜样。当他要给彼得洗脚时，这个门徒先是拒绝让基督洗他的脚。当基督告诉彼得这是他的心愿时，彼得请求他连自己的手和头也洗了。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus eats the Passover with his disciples &ndash; Luke 22:14-18</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣与门徒同吃逾越节晚餐 &ndash; 路加福音22：14-18</strong></p>
<p>There was much ceremony connected with the Passover meal.  It was a celebration service.  Psalms were sung (the Great Hallel), food was enjoyed together – in a special sequence – with a cup of wine shared between each course of food. Jesus’ heart was filled with joy.  But Jesus’ joy was tempered by the fact that his suffering and death would happen this Friday which had begun with the setting of the sun on Thursday.</p>
<p>逾越节晚餐有很多的仪式，是庆祝的仪式，按照特定的顺序 -唱诗歌（哈利路亚）、一起分享食物，在每道菜间共喝一杯葡萄酒。耶稣的心充满了喜悦。但是，随着周四太阳的西沉，周五将来临的受苦和受死，耶稣的喜悦被冲淡了。耶稣与门徒同吃逾越节晚餐</p>
<p><strong>During the dinner Jesus reveals his betrayer &ndash; John 13:18-35</strong></p>
<p><strong>晚餐时耶稣透露了他的背叛者 &ndash; 约翰福音13：18-25</strong></p>
<p>At last the Passover meal was served.  A joyful mood prevailed as the lamb, bread without yeast, and bitter herbs were being eaten.  But Jesus then made a shocking announcement: “One of you will betray me – one who is eating with me” (Mark 14:18). The disciples then became serious. Who was the betrayer?</p>
<p>最后，大家开始享用逾越节的晚餐。桌上有羔羊肉、无酵饼和苦草（bitter herbs），席间充满了喜悦。但是耶稣宣布了一个令人惊讶的消息：“你们中间有一个与我同吃的人要卖我了（马可福音14：18）”。门徒们随即变得紧张，谁是那个叛徒呢？</p>
<p>If the diagram is correct, from across the table Peter motioned and whispered to John.  John, in turn, rolled over onto his right side putting his head on Jesus’ chest. “Lord, who is it?” he asked (John 13:25).  Jesus pointed out the traitor Judas.  While Peter and John could now identify the betrayer, the rest of the disciples did not know who it was. Judas left immediately.</p>
<p>如果我们上面所绘制的图片正确，坐在桌子对面的彼得向约翰挥手并低声询问。然后，约翰就势靠在耶稣的胸前。“主啊，是谁呢？（约翰福音13:25）”。耶稣指出叛徒是犹大。此时彼得和约翰知道了这个叛徒，其他的门徒们却不知道。犹大随即离开了。</p>
<p>Jesus spoke to his believing disciples. He reminded his followers of his unity with the Father, said he soon would be glorified, and pointed out his coming sacrifice and return to heaven. Lastly, Jesus encouraged the disciples to love one another.</p>
<p>耶稣继续教导他的门徒。他提醒他们他与父的联合，提到很快他将得着荣耀，并指示他即将要牺牲，然后回到天上。最后，耶稣激励他的门徒们彼此相爱。</p>
<p><strong>After the Passover Jesus establishes his Supper &ndash; Luke 22:19-20    Mark 14:22-25 Matthew 26:26-29</strong></p>
<p><strong>逾越节后耶稣设立他的晚餐 &ndash; 马可福音14:22-25  马太福音26:26-29</strong></p>
<p>There have been different interpretations of the verses describing the Lord’s Supper, but we must simply accept what Jesus said.</p>
<p>描述“主的晚餐”的经文有很多不同的解释，但是我们一定要简单地领受接受耶稣所说的话。</p>
<p>After the Passover supper had been eaten, Jesus took a piece of the bread, said a prayer of thanksgiving, broke the bread and gave it to the disciples saying “Take and eat; this is my body . . .”  Moments later he took a cup of wine, again gave thanks, and passed it to the disciples saying, “Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood . . .” (Matthew 26:27-28).</p>
<p>当逾越节的晚餐结束后，耶稣拿起一块饼来，祝谢了，就掰开，然后递给门徒们说：“你们拿着吃，这是我的身体……”，随后，他拿起一杯酒，再次祝谢了，然后将其递给门徒们说：“你们都喝这个，这是我的血……（马太福音26：27-28）”。</p>
<p>When we add the words of St. Paul (1 Corinthians 10:16-17; 11:23-29) to the Gospel accounts, we learn about the nature of the Supper.  Jesus blessed the bread and wine while he spoke the prayer of thanksgiving.  That is to say, Jesus set the bread and wine aside for a new and holy use. What he gave and what the disciples received were bread and wine together with his own body and blood. This was the same body that would die on the cross, the same blood given for mankind’s salvation (Luke 22:20).  Nowhere did Jesus show that the bread and wine were transformed (changed; transubstantiated) into the body and blood and were no longer bread and wine (again see 1 Corinthians 10:16).  Jesus also did not say that the bread and wine merely represented (were merely a picture of) his life-giving body and blood.</p>
<p>当我们将圣保罗的话（哥林多前书10:16-17；11:23-29）放在福音的层面考虑，我们就会知道圣餐的性质。耶稣祝谢时祝福了饼和酒。这就是说他将饼和酒分别出来，为新为圣。他所给的以及门徒们所领受的，是饼和酒以及他自己的身体和宝血。这就是将死在十字架上的那个身体，这就是为所有人类的救赎而流的宝血（路加福音22:20）。耶稣没有在任何地方表明这饼和酒被转换（改变；变体）成了他的身体和宝血，并且不再是饼和酒（参看哥林多前书10:16）。耶稣也没有说过这饼和酒仅仅代表了他那具有生命的身体和宝血。</p>
<p>The Bible not only describes the nature of the Lord’s Supper, but also gives its meaning. Christ said that the Supper was a new covenant or promise from God to us: “for the forgiveness of sins” (Matthew 26:28).  By his death on the cross Jesus would pay for the sins of mankind.  Sinners receive the blessing of his death (forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation) by taking part of the meal and through faith in God’s promise (new covenant).</p>
<p>圣经不仅仅描述了主的晚餐的属性，还赋予它意义。基督表明圣餐是一个新的约定，即上帝给我们“使罪得赦”的应许（马太福音26:28）。通过死在十字架上，耶稣为人类的罪付上代价。罪人则通过领受这样的圣餐，相信神的应许（新约），就能得到他的死亡所带来的祝福（罪得赦免，生命和救赎）。
Christ also said that his followers should repeat the Supper often to remember him. In this way they would declare his death until he comes on Judgment Day (1 Corinthians 11:24-26).</p>
<p>基督还提到，他的门徒们应该常常领受圣餐来纪念他。通过这种方式，他们将宣告主的死，直到他在最后审判日再来的时候（哥林多前书11:24-26）。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus comforts and counsels his disciples &ndash; John 14:1-16:3</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣安慰和指导他的门徒 &ndash; 约翰福音14：1-16：33</strong></p>
<p>The time had come for Jesus to say good-by to his disciples.  There was much to say but little time to say it. The final words were words of comfort.</p>
<p>对于耶稣来说，是与他的门徒们说再见的时候了。有太多的话要说，但是时间不多了。最后的话是安慰的言语。</p>
<p>John’s Gospel, chapters 14-16, contains Jesus’ famous sermon on love.</p>
<p>约翰福音第14-16章，记载了耶稣著名的关于爱的讲道。</p>
<p>Perhaps it is best to show it with a series of circles. The center circle shows the unity of the Trinity, the relationship of Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Comforter).  Surrounding the Trinity is the circle of believers.  Jesus spoke of the Triune God’s relationship to them and their duties to one another. Finally, he warned the believers about the unbelievers who, in turn, surrounded them.  In times of persecution the faithful must turn their hearts toward God.</p>
<p>或许用一系列的圆环来理解这一点是最好的办法。最里面的圆环表示三位一体的联合，圣父、圣子和圣灵（劝慰子）的关系。在三位一体这个圆环的外面代表信徒们。耶稣谈到三位一体的上帝与他们的关系，并且他们彼此之间的责任。最后耶稣警告信徒们，不信的人是最外面的圆环，围绕着他们。在遭遇逼迫的时候，忠诚的人必将他们的心转向上帝。</p>
<p>Christ would leave for heaven. However, through the working of the Holy Spirit in their hearts, the disciples would remember their time with the Lord and understand the meaning of his teachings.</p>
<p>基督将会升天。然而，通过圣灵在他们心中所做的工作，门徒们将会记得他们与主在一起的时候，并且明白主的每个教导。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus says more to the disciples on the way to Gethsemane</strong></p>
<p><strong>在去客西马尼园的路上耶稣对门徒说了更多的话</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jesus predicts Peter’s denial &ndash; Luke 22:31-39</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣预言彼得不认主  &ndash; 路加福音22：31-39</strong></p>
<p>Earlier that evening Jesus had spoken about going away. Peter remembers that and so now he questioned the Lord about this. Jesus looked at the 11 disciples and then quoted Zechariah 13:7 showing that soon they would be scattered. After that time they would find him in Galilee.  Where Jesus was going, they could not follow, but Peter refused to accept this statement. He had to be told that in a few hours, before a rooster crowed two times, he would deny Jesus three times.</p>
<p>那个夜晚的早些时候，耶稣曾提到过他将离开。彼得记得这事，于是他向主问起此事。耶稣看着这十一个门徒，并引用了撒加利亚13:7来说明他们将很快地被驱散。那之后，他们会在加利利找到耶稣。耶稣所去的地方是他们不能去的，但是彼得拒绝接受这个宣告。他需要被告知几个小时之后，在鸡叫两次之前，他将三次不认主。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus directs the disciples to be prepared &ndash; Luke 22:35-38</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣嘱咐门徒做好准备 &ndash; 路加福音22：35-39</strong></p>
<p>Jesus’ departure would mark a change in the disciples’ lives. Earlier they had preached among the people and were received kindly by them. Soon these people would meet the disciples again as they witnessed for Christ. This time they would meet them with a sword.</p>
<p>耶稣的离开将给每一个门徒的生命带来一个改变。之前，他们在人群中传讲福音，人们友好地带他们。没多久，当他们为基督作见证时还会遇见这些人。这一次，人们会与他们刀剑相向。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus prays for the apostles &ndash; John 17:1-19</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣为门徒的祷告 &ndash; 约翰福音17：1-19</strong></p>
<p>Jesus had taught his disciples, and now he prayed for them as well.  His prayers followed the same order as his sermon.  He prayed for the glory which is his because he was God’s Son. Then Jesus prayed for his faithful disciples. So far he had been with them and had protected them in person. In the future they would be protected by the Sanctifier (the Holy Spirit).</p>
<p>耶稣曾教导门徒们，现在他同样为他们祷告。他的祷告和他的讲道遵循着同样的次序。他为属于他的荣耀祷告，因为他是上帝的儿子。然后他为他忠诚的门徒们祷告。一直以来，他已经与他们同在，并且亲子保守他们。未来，他将要通过成胜者（Sanctifier，圣灵）保护他们。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus prays for all believers &ndash; John 17:20-26</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣为所有信徒祷告 &ndash; 约翰福音17：20-26</strong></p>
<p>Through the ministry of the disciples many others would believe. Jesus prayed for the unity of the whole church (the believers).</p>
<p>通过门徒们的宣教工作，很多的人会得着信心。耶稣为教会的合一（信徒们）祷告。</p>
<p>Jesus had now said enough. It was time to suffer and die.</p>
<p>现在，耶稣已经说完了。是时候面对苦难和死亡了。</p>
<p><strong>Jesus prays for himself &ndash; Luke 22:39-46</strong></p>
<p><strong>耶稣为他自己祷告 &ndash; 路加福音22：39-46</strong></p>
<p>Late on Thursday Jesus and his disciples had left the room where they had finished eating the Passover meal.  They then walked out of Jerusalem, crossed the brook Kidron (John 18:1), and climbed the gentle slopes of the Mount of Olives where they entered a garden known as Gethsemane.  Jesus’ greatest struggle began in a garden just like Adam and Eve’s greatest suffering began in another garden – Eden.</p>
<p>星期四晚些时候，耶稣和他的门徒们吃完了逾越节的晚宴，就离开了那个房间。随后，他们从耶路撒冷出来，穿过汲沦溪谷（约翰福音18：1），走上橄榄山的缓坡并进入被称作客西马尼的橄榄园中。耶稣在园子里经受了内心极大的挣扎，这让人想起当初亚当和夏娃在另一个园子——伊甸园里所经历的恐慌。</p>
<p>That Passover night there was a full moon, but the olive trees made the garden darker with their shadows. But there was a greater darkness which had fallen upon the world. There was a darker enemy than Judas who was on his way to the Garden.  Satan, the Prince of Darkness, also came to tempt Jesus.  He gathered his forces for an attack upon the second Adam, Jesus. He tried to get Christ to fall just as he had gotten Adam and Eve to sin in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>逾越节的晚上满月当空，但是茂密的橄榄树让整个园子笼罩在巨大的阴影中。除此之外，正有一个更大的黑暗笼罩着这个世界。一个比犹大更黑暗的敌人将来到客西马尼园中。撒旦，黑暗之子也来到这里试探耶稣。他蓄势待发，要攻击这末后的亚当——耶稣。他试图使耶稣像亚当和夏娃在伊甸园中犯罪一样被击垮。</p>
<p>Jesus left eight disciples at the entrance to the garden and took Peter, James, and John farther inside (Matthew 26:37; Mark 14:33). They had seen Jesus in his full glory on the Mount of Transfiguration. Now they would see him in his great struggle and sadness. Jesus said to them, “My soul is overcome with sorrow to the point of death . . . Stay here and keep watch” (Mark 14:34).</p>
<p>耶稣让八个门徒留在园子的入口，并带着彼得、雅各和约翰往园子深处走去(马太福音26：37；马可福音14：33)。这三个人已经在耶稣登山变相时见过他的威荣。现在他们要看到的是耶稣极大地挣扎和哀伤。耶稣对他们说：“我心里甚是忧伤，几乎要死，你们在这里等候、警醒。” （马可福音14:34）。</p>
<p>A great sorrow caused Jesus to throw himself to the ground and resulted in a sweat like blood (Luke 22:44).  This sorrow was produced by three unholy terrors.  First, the eternal Son of God faced a condition totally strange to himself – his own death. Second, his death was a substitute for others. He would have to bear all people’s sins on his own shoulders and feel the full fury of God’s justice.  In the garden Jesus was already accepting this load. Finally, Satan was given freedom to try to scare Jesus into sinning. While all this was happening, the disciples slept.  Rather than judging the disciples too harshly, we would do well to examine the reason for their slumbers.  He found them very tired because of their sorrow (Luke 22:45). Their spirits were willing to obey Jesus (Mark 14:38), but their bodies were totally out of energy.</p>
<p>巨大的哀伤使耶稣俯伏在地，汗滴如大血点一样滴在地上（路加福音22：44）。这样的忧伤源于三种来自于人性的恐惧。首先，上帝永恒的儿子要面对一种前所未有的局面——他自己的死亡。其次，他是为别人而死。他将要独自承受所有人的罪和全然感受因上帝公义而来的列怒。在客西马尼园中，他已经预备好领受这一切。最后，撒旦任由己意妄图恐吓耶稣以使他犯罪。当这一切发生的时候，他的门徒们都睡着了。我们不应过于严厉地论断这些门徒们，但是可以好好地探究一下他们睡着的原因。耶稣发现他们因为忧愁而过于疲倦（路加福音22:45）。他们的灵固然愿意顺服耶稣（马可福音14:38），他们的肉体却软弱了。</p>
<h2 id="good-friday-night-受难日晚上">Good Friday Night 受难日晚上</h2>
<p>At long last, in the early hours of Good Friday, Jesus reported, “The time has come” (Mark 14:41). The right time about which Jesus had so often spoken had now arrived.  The two opposing forces would now meet in battle:  Jesus and Satan.</p>
<p>最后，在受难日的最初几个小时，耶稣对他们说：“时候到了”（马可福音14:41）。这个耶稣曾多次提到的时刻终于来到了。正邪之间将进行最后的对决：耶稣和撒旦。</p>
