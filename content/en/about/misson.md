The Grace Bible Institute has a three-fold mission: 
1.	Provide students with Christ-centered teaching in Christian theology from highly-skilled teachers that will help them grow and mature in Christian faith and understanding. 
2.	Provide training in ministry skills and Christian theology that will help professional church workers improve their ministry and become more gospel-oriented in their preaching and teaching. 
3.	Prepare students for an appropriate ministry role in a local independent congregation or small fellowship group.
