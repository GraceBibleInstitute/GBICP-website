## Course Description
Although other GBI courses have a lesson or two on the subject of baptism, this course will cover the doctrine much more completely. Special attention will be given to the topic of the baptism of babies because this is a doctrine that is rejected by many false teachers.  

## Course Objectives
The objectives of this course are to help students:

1. Be familiar with the Bible passages that teach the doctrine of baptism. 
2. Gain a better appreciation for the blessings of baptism. 
3. Be prepared to defend the doctrine of the baptism of infants with anyone who challenges it. 
4. Administer baptism in agreement with the Biblical principles. 

## Requirements

- This course is open to any GBI student. 
- This course is an elective course in all three certificate programs.
