## Course Description

The Augsburg Confession is one of the most important documents of the Christian church. It contains 28 concise articles on the basic truths of the Christian faith and their application to church life. This course is the first of two courses in our curriculum that will cover the entire Confession.

The Augsburg Confession is named after the city of Augsburg, Germany, where it was first presented. It is a bold and fearless confession of the truths of Scripture by men who risked their careers, reputation, and even their very lives to present it. Each article of the confession covers one of the basic truths of the Christian faith in a clear and simple way.
Every Christian should be familiar with this confession. We are pleased to be able to offer this course to you.
