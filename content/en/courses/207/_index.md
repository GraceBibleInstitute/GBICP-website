## Description

Doctor Martin Luther wrote the Small Catechism in 1529 in order to help parents teach their children the basic truths of the Christian faith. The word “catechism” means that the teaching takes place through a set of questions and answers. This little book has become a classic of Christian literature and is used to instruct children in thousands of Christian churches around the world.

The six main parts of Christian doctrine that are covered in this book are:

1. The Ten Commandments.
2. The Apostles Creed.
3. The Lord’s Prayer.
4. The Sacrament of Holy Baptism.
