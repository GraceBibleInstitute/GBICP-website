**Jesus calls Levi [Matthew] -- Luke 5:27-32  Matthew 9:9-13**

**耶稣呼召利未人【马太】-- 路加福音5：27-32    马太9:9-13**

Jesus spent that evening with some of the religious leaders of Israel. Soon after, he was surrounded by people who were not respected in society.  They were well known as sinners and were dinner guests of a man called Levi.

那夜耶稣和一些以色列的宗教领袖一起度过。很快他被那些在社会上不怎么受人尊重的人围绕着。他们是众所周知的罪人，也同样是利未宴请的客人。

Earlier that day Jesus had preached near the Sea of Galilee. Close by was the great highway running north to Damascus. Since this road was heavily traveled by merchants, the Roman government had set up toll booths. There tax collectors gathered import and export fees. These tax collectors often cheated people.  They also worked for the Roman government.  As a result, the Jews hated them.

前一天耶稣已经在加利利海附近传道。附近就是去北面大马士革的大路。既然这条率有大量的商人经过，罗马政府自然设立了收税站。在这儿税吏收取进出口费。这些税吏经常骗人。他们也是为罗马政府工作的。当然犹太人憎恨他们。

When Jesus passed the tax collector Levi, he said, “Follow me” (Matthew 9:9). Levi did follow Jesus.  Shortly afterwards he invited Jesus and his disciples to a dinner also attended by his friends.  When the Pharisees and Scribes heard of this they became angry. Jesus’ response to them has warmed the hearts of repentant sinners to this day: “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance” (Luke 5:31-32).

当耶稣从税吏利未身边经过时，他说：“跟从我”（太9:9）利未就跟从了耶稣。随后他立刻邀请耶稣和他的门徒到家里吃晚餐，他的朋友们也参加。当法利赛人和文士听说这件事时就发怒。耶稣的反应至今为止都温暖着认罪悔改人的心: “无病的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着。我来本不是召义人悔改，乃是召罪人悔改”（路5:31-2）。

**Jesus chooses the Twelve -- Luke 6:12-16; Matthew 10:2-4; Mark 3:13-19**

**耶稣拣选十二个门徒 -- 路加福音6：12-16; 马太福音10：2-4; 马可福音3：13-19**

One evening in the spring of A.D. 28 Jesus went for a walk. Leaving Capernaum, Jesus hiked to a mountain top where he could be alone and pray all night long.

在公元28年春天的一个傍晚，耶稣出去散步。离开迦百农之后耶稣隐藏在山顶，在这儿他可以独处，并且整夜祷告。

As Jesus talked to his Father he was thinking about a big decision he had to make. The time had come to choose a dozen men who would become his students. They would be with Jesus, learn from his words and carry his message to many other people. After Jesus went to heaven, these followers would lead and spread his church on earth.

在他与天父交谈时，正在考虑他必须要做的一项重要决定。是时候选择12个使徒成为他的学生了。他们会跟从耶稣，学习他的话语，把他的福音传给更多的人。耶稣回到天国后，这些跟随者也能够引领并扩大地上的教会。

Jesus reached his decision. He now chose 12 men as his special apostles.  He had already called Peter, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Nathanael (Bartholomew), and Matthew.  Now he added Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus (Lebbaeus, Judas), Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

耶稣最终做了决定。现在他选择了12个人做他的特别使徒。他已经呼召了彼得、安得烈、雅各、约翰、腓力、拿但业（巴多罗买）。再加上多马、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、达太（，犹大）、奋锐党西门、加略人犹大。

**What it means to follow Jesus -- Luke 9:57-62**

**跟随耶稣意味着什么 -- 路加福音9：57-62**

Jesus wants us, who follow him, to be ready to pay the price. That price may include loss of earthly comforts. In order for Jesus to obey the Father’s will, Jesus left his home in Nazareth and became an itinerant teacher and preacher of God’s Word. 

耶稣想要我们基督徒准备好付出代价。这代价可能包括失去属世的舒适。因为顺服圣父的旨意，耶稣离开祂在拿撒勒的家，成为旅行教师和传讲上帝话语的讲道人。

In this world we must associate with or live among the people of this world. However, when our earthly friendships or family relationships threaten to prevent us from putting Jesus first in our lives (Luke 12:31), we must choose Jesus, not the people of this world.

在这个世界上，我们必须与人相交，生活在人群中。然而，当我们属世的友情或亲情威胁到耶稣在我们生活中的首要位置时（路加福音12：31），我们必须选择耶稣，而不是这个世界上的人。

Jesus wants followers who will follow at all times. Jesus does not want us to be distracted by our allegiance to this world.

耶稣希望我们基督徒在任何时候都跟从祂。耶稣不希望我们被世界的联系羁绊。

**The sermon on the Mount -- Matthew 5:1-7:29; Luke 6:17-49**

**登山宝训 -- 马太福音5：1-7：29 ; 路加福音6：17-49**

By the time Jesus had completed calling “The Twelve” a large crowd had gathered. Jesus found a level place on the mountain and there preached the sermon we now call the Sermon on the Mount. This, the longest sermon of Jesus in the Bible, was a message for those who already believed in him. Thus, his purpose was not to bring them to faith, but to outline what it meant to follow him.

耶稣呼召完“十二”门徒时，很多人已经聚集起来。耶稣在山上找到一处平地讲道，就是现在我们成为登山宝训的。这是圣经中耶稣最长的一次讲道，是对于那些已经信耶稣的人所传讲的讯息。因此，他的目的不是带领他们信主，而是概述了要跟从他意味着什么。

In his sermon Jesus discussed two main subjects: the believer’s relationship to God and the believer’s relationship to other people. The Savior mixed these two subjects together as he taught about everything from prayer to charity, from judging to divorce. The whole time he kept emphasizing that faith is a matter of the heart, not of going through outward actions.

耶稣在讲道中讨论了两个主题：信徒与上帝的关系、信徒与其他人的关系。救世主在教导中将这两个主题混合起来，从祷告到怜恤，从论断到休妻。在这段时间里耶稣一直强调信是关乎人的内心的事，而不在乎外在的行为。

**The Beatitudes 八福**

Jesus’ sermon opened with the statements which we call the “Beatitudes.”  The word “beatitude” comes from the Latin word that means “blessed,” the first word in each statement. Only believers have the spiritual gift of being blessed.  In the first four beatitudes Jesus discussed the connection between believers and God. In the last four he taught about how believers were to act towards other humans. This is similar to the two parts of the Ten Commandments.

耶稣的讲道以我们称之为“八福”的陈述开始。“八福”这个词来源于拉丁文，意思是“享受天国之福的”，出现在每个陈述的第一个字。只有信徒才有这种被祝福的属灵礼物。前面四个讲的是信徒和上帝之间的关系。后面四个教导是关于信徒应该如何对待其他人的。这与十诫的两个部分相似。

1. Blessed are the poor in spirit.  The poor in spirit are those people who are aware that they are spiritually poor.  They know that they have nothing to offer God, that they are full of sin. They feel unworthy of God's blessings. They are the ones who will enjoy the gifts of God.  

    虚心的人有福了。虚心的人是指那些意识到他们在属灵上的贫乏。他们知道自己没有什么可以给上帝，他们充满了罪。他们觉得不配上帝的祝福。他们正是将要享有上帝礼物的人。

2. Blessed are those who mourn.  These are the people who are distressed because of their sin.  They know that sin separates them from God. Yet they will be assured of God's love and forgiveness.

    哀恸的人有福了。这是指因为罪而哀伤的人。他们知道罪使他们与神隔绝。然而他们必将拥有上帝的爱和饶恕。

3. Blessed are the meek.  These are the Christians who realize their proper place before God and wish to do his will. They will benefit from the earth, for all things will work for their good both now and in the next life. 

    温柔的人有福了。是指在上帝面前知道自己合适位置的基督徒，并希望按照上帝的旨意行事。他们在地上的日子获益，因为万事都叫他们在今时到以后都得益处。

4. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.  These are the people who eagerly wish and try to be holy as God wishes them to be. They will, through faith in Jesus Christ, be declared holy by God.

    饥渴慕义的人有福了。这是指那些渴慕并且试着过上帝所期望的圣洁的生活。借着耶稣基督他们被上帝称圣。

5. Blessed are the merciful.  Those Christians are filled with love for all humans. They will obtain mercy. 

    怜恤的人有福了。是指那些对全人类充满爱的基督徒。他们也同样会得到怜恤。

6. Blessed are the pure in heart.  These are the people who honestly say what they believe in their hearts. Like Adam before the fall, they will one day see God, face to face.

    清心的人有福了。是指那些诚实地说出他们内心所信的。正如亚当落入罪中之前，他们有一天会见到上帝，与上帝面对面。

7. Blessed are the peacemakers.  They strive for harmony and try to live in peace with everyone and everything. They are God's children because they are living like their heavenly Father.

    使人和睦的人有福了。他们为和谐而奋斗，试图与每个人和平相处。他们是上帝的孩子，因为他们像天父一样生活。

8. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.  Such people are willing to be disliked, dishonored, abused, or suffer in any way because of their faith. They will be honored and accepted in God's Kingdom.

    为义受逼迫的人有福了。这样的人为了他们的信仰，甘愿被人们厌弃、侮辱、虐待或者忍受任何形式的逼迫。在上帝的国度里他们将被尊敬和接纳。

Thus Jesus first taught that true religion is a matter of what is inside (what is in the heart, the gifts promised and provided by God).  Jesus now went on to condemn how the Pharisees put their trust in outward actions. [We are all self-righteous people.]  They put their trust in their own actions and are only concerned with how they are viewed by other people. Their reward for being only concerned about what others think is soon gone.

因此耶稣首先教导说，真正的信仰是关于内在的（在人的内心，是上帝应许的、也是由上帝而来的礼物）。耶稣现在继续谴责法利赛人是如何把他们的信建立在外在的行为上的。我们都是自以为是的人。他们将信放在自己的行为上，而且只关心别人如何看待自己。他们的奖赏，因为只关注在别人如何看待他们上面，所以很快就没有了。

People with faith in their hearts have a very important role to play in the world. They are, and must remain, salt and light. Salt is used to preserve food. As a seasoning it adds flavor. Salt is also necessary for the body to live. In the same way Christians bring decency and order to our dying world.  In this way Christians help to preserve it. And it doesn’t take many Christians to have a good effect on society. But Christians are not to remain a hidden force. They are to make their presence known. They are to light up the world's darkness. They are to be lights of hope for all to see.

将信仰放在内心深处的人在世上的这场戏剧中扮演非常重要的角色。他们是盐和光，而且必须要保持下去。盐用来保存食物；作为调味品，盐增加味道。盐也是人体生命的必须品。同样，基督徒为我们将死的世界带来正直和秩序。这样基督徒帮助人们保存它。而这并没有让很多基督徒在社会上有好的影响。但基督徒是只保留隐藏的力量。他们现在要让人们知道他们。他们要照亮世界的黑暗。他们是所有人能看到的希望之光。

At this point in his sermon, Christ became more personal. He briefly spoke of his role as the Messiah (the Christ). He came not to fight Rome, but to fulfill the Scriptures (the Law and the Prophets) for mankind’s credit. When Christ perfectly obeyed the Law, he did not do it by just outwardly obeying it.  He obeyed because of his pure heart.

在讲道中，所有这些要点，基督都变得更个性化了。他简单地谈到作为弥赛亚他的职分。他来不是为了攻击罗马人，而是要为了人类的信用完成旧约中提到的使命（律法和预言）。当基督完美地遵行律法时，他并不只是外在地遵行。他遵行律法是因为他有一颗单纯的心。

Jesus’ followers must also be concerned with their hearts. They must realize that murder develops from anger, and adultery comes from lust. The Law was written to protect our neighbor’s body and marriage. Truth is truth; lie is lie.  People should not need to take oaths, but if they do they should keep them.  Revenge is also a sin that has roots in man's heart. The desire for revenge must be replaced with understanding and love. In all things the example of God should fill the heart of the disciple: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matthew 5:48).

他的信徒也必须关注他们的内心。他们必须意识到，杀戮由怒气而生，奸淫出于肉欲。律法写出来是为了保护我们身体的洁净和婚姻的。真理是真理；谎言是谎言。人们不必发誓，但如果发誓就应该遵行誓言。报复也是深植人心的罪。想要报复的那种欲望必须由理解和爱来代替。上帝在诸事上的模范样子应该充满使徒的心：“所以你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样”（太5：48）。

A pure heart shows itself in a truly Christian life and heart. Acts of holiness should not be done to impress people. Rather they should be done quietly. This applies to giving offerings, praying, and fasting. Believers should always keep their minds on God's kingdom. Loving possessions and luxury leads to greed and constant worry.

清心呈现在一位真正的基督徒的生活和内心中。神圣的行为不应该是为了给人们留下深刻的印象。这种事应该行在暗处。这同样适用于奉献、祷告和禁食。信徒应该将心思意念放在神的国度上。对财产和享乐的喜爱导致贪婪和不断的忧虑。

As we have seen, Jesus in his sermon blended these two thoughts. The disciple’s heart must be in proper relationship to God and to his fellow man. Jesus was still teaching these same things at the end of his sermon. He taught that believers do not judge hearts. They do not allow the holy things of God to be treated as unclean.  Believers speak from their hearts to God through prayer, and he blesses them with the best things. When disciples are faced with false prophets they maintain God’s Word in its truth and purity.

正如我们所看到的，耶稣在他的讲道中混合了这两个想法。对于使徒同上帝和同伴的关系，他们必须摆正心态。耶稣在讲道结尾的部分又教导了同样的事情。他教导说，信徒不要论断。他们不允许向上帝所行得神圣的事被看做不洁净。信徒通过祷告将他们对上帝的信表达出来，而且上帝给他们最好的祝福。当使徒面对假先知的时候，他们仍能保持上帝的真理和完全。

Finally, Jesus wanted the crowd to understand that his words were not just fine sayings that made good sense.  They were the words of truth, the words of God, which must be obeyed.

最后，耶稣想要会众们明白，他所讲的这些不只是有道理的好听的话而已。而是有关真理的话，是我们必须要遵行的上的话。

As the people left the mountain that day they were “amazed” (Matthew 7:28). Unlike the Scribes, Jesus had not given a talk about small issues. He had taken divine truth and showed what it meant in their everyday lives. He had ended some of their greatest doubts. In the days ahead they would try to sort out the meaning of every statement and how it fit into the rest of his teachings.

那天会众离开山的时候他们“稀奇”（太7:28）。与文士不同，耶稣所讲到的不是小事。他讲的是神圣的真理，并表明这在基督徒的日常生活中的意义。耶稣解决了他们最大的疑惑。未来他们会试着整理每一个陈述的意思，也会发现它是如何与耶稣其他的教导融合到一起的。

**Jesus calms a storm -- Luke 8:22-25; Matthew 8:23-27; Mark 4:36-41**

**耶稣平息风浪 -- 路加福音8：22-25    马太福音8：23-27    马可福音4：36-41**

By now it was evening.  To escape the crowd Jesus and the disciples found a boat to take them across the Sea of Galilee. Before they could leave, however, three men asked to become his disciples. Jesus warned them that such a commitment would mean great personal sacrifice. They would have to put God's work first in their lives. The men left.

现在夜晚已经来临。为了避开人群，耶稣和门徒们找到一艘船带他们穿过加利利海。然而在他们离开之前，三个人想要成为耶稣的门徒。耶稣告诫他们成为他的门徒意味着巨大的个人牺牲。他们必须把上帝的事放在生命的首位。那人就离开了。

Jesus and the disciples then began to sail across the lake.  Jesus soon fell into a deep sleep. As frequently happens on that sea, a sudden and violent storm arose. The boat began to sink. The disciples were full of terror and woke Jesus.  They shouted, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?” (Mark 4:38).

耶稣和门徒随后开始乘船度过加利利湖。耶稣很快就熟睡了。海上突然起了风暴，这在加利利海是常发生的事。船开始下沉。门徒们非常恐惧就叫醒耶稣。他们喊道：“夫子，我们丧命，你不顾吗？”（可4:38）。

Jesus got up and took care of the problem. He spoke two commands: “Silence, be quiet!” (Mark 4:39)  Immediately there was a complete calm. The disciples were totally amazed. Thus, Jesus’ busiest day came to a close.

耶稣起来解决他们的问题。他发出了两项指令。“住了吧，静了吧”（可4:39）！海面立刻平静了。门徒们全然惊呆了。至此，耶稣最忙碌的一天结束了。

**Jesus drives demons from two men -- Luke 8:26-27; Matthew 8:28-34; Mark 5:1-20**

**耶稣为两个人赶鬼 -- 路加福音8：26-27   马太福音8：28-34  马可福音5:1-20**

The morning following Jesus’ busiest day the Lord Jesus and his disciples were still in their boat on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. As soon as they came to shore, Jesus was met by two men possessed by demons. The Gospels tell us especially about what happened to one of the men.

最忙碌的那天之后的早晨，主耶稣和门徒仍然停留在加利利海东岸的船上。他们一上岸，就有两个被鬼附的人来迎他。福音书中特别讲述了其中一个人身上发生的事。

Jesus spoke to the demons and threw them out of the man. The demons then entered a herd of pigs.  These pigs then ran over a cliff into the sea.  The one man then began to witness to others about the power of God..

耶稣对魔鬼说法并把他们从那人里赶出来。后来魔鬼进了一群猪里。这些猪闯下山崖掉进海里。随后这人就开始告诉别人上帝的大能。

**Jesus heals a man who is paralyzed -- Luke 5:17-26; Matthew 9:2-8; Mark 2:1-12**

**耶稣医治了一个瘫子 -- 路加福音5：17-26    马太福音9：2-8  马可福音2：1-12**

After many days, perhaps weeks, Jesus returned to Capernaum. Soon a crowd gathered. But not all of these people were local people. Pharisees and Scribes from various Galilean towns and from far away Jerusalem had traveled to hear and see Jesus. Many of these men were religious leaders.  They wanted to keep an eye on Jesus.

过了很多天，大概有几周的时间，耶稣回到迦百农。就有许多人聚集。并非都是当地人。有法利赛人和教法师，他们从加利利个乡村和从遥远的耶路撒冷赶来的，为的是听耶稣讲道，看看耶稣。很多人都是宗教领袖。他们想要注意耶稣的举动。

An unusual event took place one day while Jesus was preaching to a large gathering inside Peter's house.  Four men had promised to help their paralyzed friend by taking him to Jesus. But a large crowd blocked the doors so they could not get close to Jesus. Instead they carried their paralyzed friend up the outside stairs to the top of the flat roof.  Then they removed some of the roof tiles, and using ropes lowered him down on a mattress.

有一天，耶稣正在彼得家给很多聚集起来的人讲道的时候，一件非同寻常的事儿发生了。一个瘫子的四个朋友答应帮助他来到耶稣面前。但人太多了，堵住了们，所以他们无法接近耶稣。他们抬着瘫痪的朋友上了外面的楼梯，到达平的屋顶。然后他们移走了一些瓦，用绳子连同床垫一起坠到房子里。

Jesus, however, didn't just cure the man. Instead he said something very unexpected: “Friend, your sins are forgiven” (Luke 5:20). The Pharisees and Scribes immediately became angry.  They thought, “Who can forgive sins but God alone?” But that was the point Jesus was trying to make. Jesus was himself truly God. Then Christ healed the man. On that day the Lord gave a public show of his divine authority to forgive sins and of his power to heal.

耶稣当然并不仅仅是医治了这个瘫子。他说了让人意想不到的话：“朋友，你的罪赦了”（路5:20）。法利赛人和文士即刻就生气了。他们想，“除了神以外，谁能赦罪呢？”这正是耶稣想要说的。耶稣本人就是真神。然后基督医治了瘫子。那天主公开鲜明他的天赐的赦罪权柄，还有医治的力量。

**Jesus teaches about fasting -- Luke 5:33-39; Matthew 9:14-17; Mark 2:18-22**

**耶稣关于禁食的教导 -- 路加福音5：33-39  马太福音9：14-17   马可福音2：18-22**

It was becoming more and more clear that Jesus’ teaching and life was very different from the religion practiced by the Pharisees. Among other things, Jesus did not encourage his disciples to fast. When he was asked about this, his answer was simple. Since Jesus was with his disciples now in person, it was not the right time to fast.  Fasting was done to show grief and sorrow. After Jesus returned to heaven, then his disciples could fast.

耶稣有关生活的教导与法利赛人所精通的宗教教导之间的不同越来越明显了。在耶稣所教导的诸多事情之中，他并不鼓励门徒禁食。当他被询问禁食的事儿时，他的回答很简单。既然现在耶稣亲子和门徒在一起，那就不是禁食的好时候。禁食用来显明悲伤和悔恨。耶稣回到天堂之后，他的门徒就才应当禁食。

## Appendix:  Fasting 附录：禁食

The following was written by Pastor Joel Prange. 

下列是Joel Prange 牧师所写

[His words are slightly edited here.] [略有修改】

Jesus lived at a time when fasting was more popular than at any other time in Jewish history, ancient or modern. Jesus took fasting for granted. Jesus agreed with the prophetic condemnation of external and insincere fasting. But Jesus did not condemn the practice itself.  Jesus Himself fasted for 40 days at the beginning of His ministry.

耶稣生活的时代，禁食盛行，比犹太历史上任何古代或现代的时侯都更受欢迎。耶稣认为禁食是理所当然的。耶稣认同先知对外在和虚伪的禁食的谴责，但是耶稣并没有谴责禁食的行为本身。耶稣在他开始传道前禁食了40天。

Although we do not read that Jesus fasted at any other time, Jesus apparently also observed the national days of fasting since His opponents do not fault Him for failing to do so. Jesus made two statements on the subject of fasting. The first is in Matthew 6:16-18. 

虽然我们没有读到耶稣在任何其他时间禁食，但是显然耶稣遵守全国的禁食日，因为他的对手并没有因为耶稣没有这样做而批评他。耶稣就禁食作过两次宣讲。第一次是在马太福音6：16-18。

“When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil, on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and you Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.” 

“你们禁食的时候，不可像那假冒为善的人，脸上带着愁容；因为他们把脸弄得难看，故意叫人看出他们是禁食。我实在告诉你们，他们已经得了他们的赏赐。你禁食的时候，要梳头洗脸，不叫人看出你禁食来，只叫你暗中的父看见；你父在暗中察看，必然报答你。”

We see here that fasting is indeed neither commanded nor condemned. But when fasting is done (and Jesus apparently expects that fasting will be done), fasting is not to be done for show before other people. Jesus’ second statement regarding fasting is Matthew 9:14-15. 

在这里我们看到确实不存在对禁食的命令或谴责。但是当禁食的时侯（耶稣显然希望我们有禁食），禁食不是要做给人看的。耶稣关于禁食的第二次教导是在马太福音9：14-15。

“Then John’s disciples came and asked him, ‘How is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?’ Jesus answered, 'How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.”

“那时，约翰的门徒来见耶稣，说：我们和法利赛人常常禁食，你的门徒倒不禁食，这是为甚麽呢？耶稣对他们说：新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，陪伴之人岂能哀恸呢？但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那时候他们就要禁食。”

Here Jesus refused to make any rules for His followers about fasting. In fact, He de-emphasized fasting by saying that the characteristic of His kingdom was to be joy and feasting, not sorrow and fasting. And yet he anticipated a time when His followers “will fast.” 

在这里，耶稣拒绝为基督徒制定关于禁食的规则。事实上，他不再强调禁食，而是说他的国度的特点是喜乐和宴乐，而不是悲伤和禁食。然而他预料到时候将到，基督徒“会禁食”。

There is no command to fast. But one cannot avoid saying that Jesus anticipated fasting among His followers. Even though the disciples were enjoying the bridegroom right then, Jesus indicated (in John 16:20, for example) that there would still be times of weeping, lamenting, and sorrow for them. It was especially the words of Matthew 9:15 ("then they will fast") that were used to promote and defend the practice of fasting in the Christian Church in the centuries after Christ.

没有必须禁食的命令。但人们可以说耶稣预期基督徒中将会有禁食。即使门徒正在享受新郎的当时，耶稣也指出（在约翰福音16:20），他们仍然会有哭泣，悲伤和忧愁的时侯。特别是马太福音9:15（“那时侯他们就会禁食”）的话，被用来在基督之后的几个世纪里提倡和捍卫基督教会禁食的做法。
