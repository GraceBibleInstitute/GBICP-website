**Jesus goes to the Feast of Tabernacles -- John 7:1-13**

**耶稣去守住棚节 -- 约翰福音7：1-13**

Throughout his life many people had tried to force Jesus into doing what they wanted done. Mary, for example had asked Jesus to help at the wedding in Cana. The five thousand who had been fed by the fish and bread wanted to force Jesus to become their earthly king. Now again well-meaning people tried to tell the Almighty Savior what he should do. This time it was Jesus’ own half-brothers (see Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3).

纵观耶稣的一生，太多的人试图迫使耶稣按照他们想要的去做。比如马利亚在迦拿的婚宴上就曾请求耶稣的帮助。已经吃饱了饼和鱼的5000人，希望迫使耶稣成为他们世上的国王。如今，好心的人再次使徒告诉这位全能的救主，什么是他应该做的。这一次，他们是与耶稣亲如兄弟的人们。

The Feast of Tabernacles was about to take place. At this yearly event, held in October in A.D. 29, the Jews remembered the 40 years their ancestors had wandered in the wilderness by living in tabernacles (tents). Like thousands of other Galilean pilgrims, Jesus’ relatives were preparing for the trip to Jerusalem. They asked Christ to go along and do some miracles in the big city. Like so many others, they believed Jesus could be a Messiah who could lead Israel to political independence.  But they failed to accept him as the deliverer from sin, eternal death, and the power of Satan.

住棚节即将要开始了。发生在公元29年十月份的这个年度的事件中，犹太人纪念他们的先祖40年在旷野徘徊，住在帐篷里。像成千上万的加利利朝圣者们一样，耶稣的亲戚们也准备好前往耶路撒冷。他们请基督一同前往，并在那个大城市里施展些神迹奇事。像其他很多人一样，他们相信耶稣可能就是弥赛亚，那个能够带领以色列在政治上独立的人。但是他们并未认同他就是那位将他们从罪、永远的死亡和撒旦的权势下拯救出来的人。

Jesus did not go with them.  But, once they had left, he and his disciples did go on to Jerusalem by themselves. In April of the next year Jesus would make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  That was the right time according to his timetable.

耶稣没有跟他们同行。但是，当他们离开后，耶稣和他的门徒们也出发独自前往耶路撒冷。在第二年的四月份，耶稣将要荣耀地进入圣城。那才是他时间表中的完美时刻。

**Jesus teaches at the Feast -- John 7:14-24**

**耶稣在节期教训人 -- 约翰福音7：14-24**

The Feast of Tabernacles lasted for 8 days. As Jesus taught the crowds, the Jewish leaders were unable to explain how Jesus had become so wise and learned. Jesus explained that his heavenly Father had taught him. This claim to be God’s Son angered the Jewish leaders.  

住棚节有八天。当耶稣教导众人时，犹太人的领袖不能解释为什么耶稣会这么有智慧和有学问。耶稣解释他的天父吩咐过他。他自称为上帝的儿子的宣告激怒了犹太人的领袖。

Jesus exposed their desire to kill him. Quickly the Jewish leaders denied the accusation and returned to their false charge that Jesus was using demonic powers to do miracles and that Jesus was breaking the law by working miracles on the Sabbath.

耶稣暴露了他们要杀害他的欲望。很快犹太人的领袖否认这个控诉，回到他们的虚假的指控：耶稣在使用魔鬼的能力来行神迹奇事，耶稣在安息日行神迹违背了律法。
  
**Is Jesus the Christ -- John 7:25-44**

**耶稣是基督吗 -- 约翰福音7：25-44**

The crowds were looking for a signal from their leaders. They now began to wonder if their leaders had concluded that Jesus was the Christ. The people were confused about Jesus. So Jesus again asserted – publicly, in the Temple area – that he was God’s Son. Some believed.  The leaders tried to seize Jesus.  But Jesus’ enemies were not able to harm him. Jesus’ time to suffer and die had not yet arrived.

众人在看他们领袖的信号。他们现在开始想知道是否他们的领袖做出了决定：耶稣是基督。人们对耶稣感到困惑。所以耶稣再次在殿里公开地宣称——他是上帝的儿子。有些人相信了。领袖们试图抓住耶稣。但是耶稣的敌人们未能伤害他。耶稣受难和受死的时候还没有到。

One of the ceremonies observed at the Feast of Tabernacles included a portrayal of the rock which Moses struck in the desert so that water ran from it (Exodus 17).  Jesus told the crowds that this rock was a picture of himself and of all who trusted in him (John 7:37-38).  Paul restated this truth in 1 Corinthians 10:4.

住棚节的仪式之一是摩西在沙漠里击打岩石出水的图画（出埃及记17）。耶稣告诉众人这岩石是他自己和所有相信他的人（约翰福音7：37-38）。保罗在哥林多前书10：4里重述了这个真理。

The crowd was divided. Was Jesus a prophet or the Savior? Should He live or die? Even the temple guards sent to arrest him became confused.

人群散开了。耶稣是一个先知，还是救世主呢？他该或者还是死去呢？甚至连派去抓捕耶稣的守卫也变得迷惑了。

**The unbelief of the Jewish leaders (part 1) -- John 7:45-53; 8:1**

**犹太人领袖的不信（第一部分）-- 约翰福音7：45-53；8：1**

The great majority of the Jewish leaders rejected Jesus. But not all of them rejected Jesus.  Nicodemus spoke up to defend Jesus.  Nicodemus’ fellow leaders made fun of him. By asking Nicodemus, “Are you from Galilee?” they were saying Nicodemus was stupid to think Jesus could be the Christ.  After Jesus’ death, Nicodemus will publicly confess his faith in Jesus by helping to bury his body (John 19:38-42).

犹太人领袖的绝大多数反对耶稣。但不是所有的犹太人领袖都反对耶稣。尼哥底母为耶稣辩护。尼哥底母的同伴领袖们嘲笑他。他们问尼哥底母说，“你是从加利利来的吗？”他们说尼哥底母认为耶稣是基督是愚蠢的。在耶稣死后，尼哥底母以帮助埋葬耶稣的身体这件事，公开承认他对耶稣的信心。
    
**A woman is caught in adultery -- John 8:2-11**

**一个在行淫时被抓的妇人 -- 约翰福音8：2-11**

The day after the Feast ended, Jesus came to the temple courtyard. There the Jewish leaders tried to trap him. A woman caught in the act of adultery was brought before him. The Jews wondered whether or not he would forgive her sins, since the Law of Moses said this sin should be punished by stoning the sinner to death (Deuteronomy 22:24; Leviticus 20:10). The Lord answered with a single sentence: “If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her” (John 8:7; see Deuteronomy 17:7).

节日结束后，耶稣来到圣殿的外院。犹太的领袖们在那里使徒陷害他。一个犯了淫乱被抓到的妇女被带到耶稣面前。犹太人想知道耶稣是否会赦免她的罪，因为摩西的律法中说，惩罚这样的罪时应该用石头将罪人打死（申命记22:24；利未记20:10）。主用一句话作为回答：“你们中间谁是没有罪的，谁就可以先拿石头打她。”（约翰福音8:7；参见申命记17:7）。

**Jesus’ testimony is valid -- John 8:12-30**

**耶稣的见证是有效的 -- 约翰福音8：12-30**

Jesus asserts that he is the LORD when he says “I AM the light of the world” (John 8:12).  Think of Psalm 119:105.  Compare John 1:1:14. This bold claim angered the Pharisees. They refused to believe that Jesus is the Son of God.

耶稣宣称他是主。他说“我是世界的光”（约翰福音8：12）。默想诗篇119：105。比较约翰福音1：14。这个大胆的宣告激怒了法利赛人。他们拒绝相信耶稣是上帝的儿子。

Jesus asserted that his testimony agrees with his other witness: His heavenly Father.  Think of the testimony the Father gave on the day when Jesus was baptized: “This is my Son” (Matthew 3:15-17). 

耶稣宣称他的见证与他的其他见证人—他的天父的见证相合。想一想在耶稣受洗的那一天天父的见证: “这是我的爱子”.（马太福音3：15-17）

Jesus told the Jewish leaders that they were headed for eternal death.  Jesus’ words warn us to avoid condemnation. Jesus’ words urge us to find life in Jesus alone. We must give our attention to Jesus’ words, the gospel invitation, so that we may believe and be saved.

耶稣告诉犹太人的领袖们说他们走向永远的死亡。耶稣的话警醒我们避免被定罪。耶稣的话鼓励我们单单在耶稣里找着生命。我们必须注意听耶稣的话，他的福音邀请，这样我们可以相信并且得救。
   
**The true children of Abraham	 -- John 8:31-47**

**亚伯拉罕真正的后裔 -- 约翰福音8：31-47**

Some of the Jewish leaders in the crowd (remember Nicodemus) listened and believed.  Jesus urged them to continue in the faith by clinging to the liberating gospel.  

人群中有的犹太人的领袖（记得尼哥底母）听了并且相信了。耶稣鼓励他们坚持使人得自由的福音，继续保持信心。

Others in the crowd (verse 33) rejected the idea that Jesus could set people free. They thought Jesus was talking about slavery in the sense of political or physical slavery. Jesus was talking about slavery to sin. Only the liberating gospel can set us sinners free from guilt and death so that we may live and not die eternally.

其他在人群中的人（33节)拒绝了耶稣可使人得自由的想法。他们认为耶稣在谈论政治或身体的奴役。耶稣谈的是被罪所捆绑的奴役。只有可使人得自由的福音能使罪人从愧疚和死亡中得自由，不致永死。

**Jesus claims to be the eternal God -- John 8:48-59**

**耶稣声称他是永远的上帝 -- 约翰福音8：48-59**

Jesus had come to the temple to speak, and he did just that. Predictably, He then discussed (John 8) many of the points he made earlier (John 7). He spoke of his authority which came from his position as God the Father's Son, of the plot against his life, of his return to heaven, and of his claim to be the source of salvation. If Jesus were to be put to death it would not be an accident or the result of a misunderstanding. Jesus was to be judged on his claim to be the eternal Son of the Father (John 8:58), the Messiah, the Savior of the world. The verdict reached by the Jewish religious leaders was that he should be stoned. However, Jesus was not yet ready to sacrifice his life.

耶稣已经来到圣殿教导，他确实做到了。不出所料，他随即讨论了（约翰福音8）很多此前提到的看法（约翰福音7）。他谈到了作为上帝的儿子而具有的权柄，谈到了害他性命的阴谋，谈到了他要回到天堂，还谈到他宣称自己是救恩的源泉。如果耶稣被杀死，那不是一个意外或者误会的结果。因为他声称自己是天父不朽的儿子、弥赛亚和救世主，他将要被审判。犹太人的宗教领袖们得出的结论是他应该被石头打死。然而，耶稣还没预备好将自己作为祭物献上。

**Jesus gives eyes to a man born blind -- John 9**

**耶稣医治一个生来瞎眼的人 -- 约翰福音9**

In the New Testament Jesus is sometimes called the “light.”  Isaiah the prophet looking forward to Christ said “The people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned” (Isaiah 9:2). Simeon holding the baby Jesus in his arms knew that Jesus would be “a light ... to the Gentiles” (Luke 2:32). The evangelist John (1:4) spoke about the Savior as “the light of men.” Finally, Jesus himself, as he addressed the Jews at the Feast of Tabernacles, exclaimed, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (John 8:12). 

在新约中，耶稣有时被称为“光”。先知以赛亚盼望基督的时候说：“在黑暗中行走的百姓，看见了大光。住在死荫之地的人，有光照耀他们。”（以赛亚书9:2）。西面怀抱着小耶稣的时候，他知道这个婴儿将成为“照亮外邦人的光”（路加福音2:32）。使徒约翰（约翰福音1:4）说到耶稣是称其为“人的光”。最后，在耶稣向犹太人演讲时，他自己大声宣告说：“我是世界的光，跟从我的，就不在黑暗里走，必要得着生命的光。”（约翰福音8:12）。

Now, after being rejected by the Jews and barely escaping from them, Jesus came upon a man who was blind from his birth. The twelve disciples did not think about the man’s personal misery.  Instead they asked Jesus why he had this handicap. The disciples, like many people, believed that a person got sick or had problems because he had committed some big sin. Jesus corrected this false idea and directed them away from the cause to the cure. 

现在，被犹太人决绝并逃离他们之后，耶稣遇见一个生来就瞎眼的人。十二个门徒并没有考虑到他个人的苦难。反而，他们问耶稣这个人为什么有这样的残缺。门徒们像很多人一样，相信一个人生病或者遇到麻烦，是因为他犯了大罪。耶稣更正了他们的错误想法，并使他们不再关注瞎眼的缘由，而关注耶稣的医治。

The Lord used this blind man to talk about his earlier teaching. Just as Jesus brought physical light (sight) to the dark world of the blind man, so Jesus brings spiritual light to souls in the darkness of sin. 

主藉着这个瞎眼的人来谈论他早前的教导。就像是他给这个瞎眼的人漆黑的世界带来光亮（视力）一样，耶稣也给那些在罪之黑暗中的灵魂带来属灵的光明。

Once again, however, hatred for Jesus blinded the Pharisees to the point that they refused to see the Light of the world. They now tried to get the man whom Jesus healed to turn against him.  But his new eyesight had let in true spiritual vision.

然而，对耶稣的敌意再一次使法利赛人看不见这一点，他们拒绝看见世界的光。现在他们试图让被医治的那人反过来抵挡耶稣。但痊愈的眼睛已经让他进入了真正属灵的视野。

**Jesus is the Good Shepherd -- John 10:1-21**

**耶稣是好牧人 -- 约翰福音10：1-21**

The events which followed the healing of the blind man filled Jesus’ heart with grief. The religious leaders of the Jews could not care for the people of God. They had already spoken threats against those who said that Jesus was the Christ (John 9:22).  And they followed through by evilly treating the case of the former blind man (9:34). Turning to the Pharisees, the disciples, the blind man, and all who could hear, Jesus spoke of shepherds and sheep (pictures that hearers of the Old Testament could easily understand, Psalm 23; Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 34).

医治了瞎子后发生的事情使耶稣心中充满了忧伤。犹太的宗教领袖不能照顾上帝的子民。他们早已威胁国那些口称耶稣是基督的人了（约翰福音9:22）。并且他们纠缠不休，恶毒地了解了此前那个瞎子的事情。耶稣转向法利赛人、门徒们、瞎子和素有能能听到的人们，谈论起牧者和羊群的教导（描绘出旧约的听众容易理解的场景，诗篇23；以赛亚书40:11；以西结书34）。

First Christ showed he was different from the false leaders. They were false shepherds; they were only hired to care for the sheep; they didn’t really care about them, but ran away when danger came.  But Jesus was a Good Shepherd.  He knows his sheep, loves them, and is willing to give his own life to protect them.

首先，基督表明他与那些假的领袖不同。他们是假牧者；他们只是雇佣来照顾羊群的；他们不是真心地关心羊，当危险来临时就跑掉了。但是耶稣是一个好牧者。他知道他的羊，爱他们，愿意为了保护他们而舍弃自己的性命。

Then Christ described his relationship to believers. Believers listened to their Shepherd’s voice.  They followed their Shepherd and thus remained safe. Jesus knew his sheep. He offered them eternal life, and no one could take the sheep away from him.

随后，基督描绘了他与信徒们的关系。信徒们听他们牧者的声音。他们跟随自己的牧者，并且因此常保平安。耶稣知道他的羊群。他给他们永生，并且每人能将这些羊从他的手中夺去。

Jesus also spoke of calling others (the Gentiles) to himself.  He explained that he was the only way to salvation. This salvation Jesus would earn for all people through his willing sacrifice on Calvary's cross.

耶稣也谈到呼召其他人（外邦人）归向他。他解释说，他是唯一得救赎的途径。这位按着耶稣的意愿，他将要在髑髅地的十字架上被献为祭物，并以此赢得所有的人。

This speech of Jesus is a New Testament version of the 23rd Psalm.  Some of the Jews were stirred to faith when they heard it.  Others said, "He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?" (John 10:20).

耶稣的这席话是诗篇23篇的新约版本。一些犹太人听到这话时就心动相信了。另外一些人说：“他是被鬼附着，而且疯了，为什么听他呢？”（约翰福音10:20）。

## Jesus Returns to Galilee  耶稣回到加利利

**At the house of Mary and Martha -- Luke 10:38-42**

**在玛利亚和马大的家里 -- 路加福音10：38-42**

Jesus traveled into Judea to a town called Bethany. There he stayed at the home of Martha and Mary (about whom we will learn more in later chapters). Martha was full of energy.  She wanted to be a perfect hostess to Jesus. Mary sat and listened to Jesus speak. Mary was the wiser. Christ praised Mary for choosing the one thing she really needed. After all, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve" (Matthew 20:28).

耶稣来到了犹大一个叫伯大尼的小城。他住在马大和马利亚（在随后的章节中我们还会了解更多关于她的事情）的家中。马大是一个精力十足的人。她想完美地招待耶稣。马利亚坐在那里，听耶稣讲道。她是聪明的。基督夸奖了马利亚，因为她选择了真正需要的。毕竟“人子来不是要受人的服侍，而是要服侍人”（马太福音20:28）。

**At Caesarea Philippi -- Luke 9:18-27**

**在凯撒利亚腓立比城 -- 路加福音9：18-27**

Jesus’ search for privacy and rest took him from Bethsaida Julias to the very northern part of Israel, to the city of Caesarea Philippi. This 30-mile walk was uphill all the way. Jesus carried with him a concern for the spiritual welfare of all mankind – of the disciples in particular. Thus, Jesus asked the disciples, “Who do people say I am?” Their answer was disappointing. The Jews considered Jesus to be a prophet sent from God, but not God’s Son, the Savior. Jesus faced the disciples and ask, “Who do you say I am?” It was Peter who gave the correct answer.  He confessed, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matt. 16:16).

耶稣希望找到安静和隐秘的地方，这个想法将他从伯赛大带到了以色列的最北边，凯撒利亚腓立比城。这30英里的路全部都是上坡。耶稣心中挂念着全人类属灵的福祉——尤其是他门徒们的。因此，他问他们：“人说我是谁？” 门徒们回答是令人失望的。犹太人以为耶稣是上帝派来的先知，但不是上帝的儿子，他们的救主。耶稣直面门徒们并问他们说：“你们说我是谁？” 彼得给出了正确的答案。他宣告说：“你是基督，是永生神的儿子。”（马太福音16:16）。

While Jesus was happy with Peter’s answer, he quickly added that it was God who had created this faith within Peter.  Anyone who makes such a Peter-like confession will gain entry into the Kingdom of God. Upon this truth the church is built. Furthermore, Jesus commanded the believers (the Church) to use God’s Law to tell unrepentant sinners that they will not enter heaven, and to use the Gospel of Jesus Christ (including the Sacraments) to unlock the gates of the kingdom for those who do repent.

当然耶稣为彼得的回答而高兴，他立即补充说，是上帝已经生发了彼得里面的信心。任何人像彼得一样宣告，都将会获准进入上帝的国度。教会就建立在这样的基础上。此外，耶稣命令信徒们（教会）使用上帝的律法，告诉那些不悔改的罪人，他们将不能进入天堂；同样使用耶稣基督的福音（包括圣礼），为那些悔改的人打开天国的大门。

Jesus knew from Peter’s confession that the disciples understood he was God’s Son. Yet they still did not understand his plan for saving the world. In order to explain this plan Jesus now began to give them details about his coming death and resurrection. Jesus said that soon they would go to Jerusalem where he would be executed by the Jewish religious leaders. But on the third day he would come to life again.

耶稣从彼得的宣告中知道，门徒们明白他是上帝的儿子。但是他们仍旧不懂耶稣拯救世界的计划。为了解释他的计划，耶稣现在开始将他即将面对的死亡和复活的细节，一一告诉他们。耶稣说没多久，他们要去耶路撒冷，在那里他将被犹太宗教领袖处以死刑。但是在第三天他将要复活。

At least once before Jesus had told about his death (John 3:14). This time, however, Peter objected. Pulling Jesus aside, Peter told Jesus he was wrong to speak about dying. Jesus answered, “Out of my sight, Satan!” (Mark 8:33). These were the same words Jesus had directed toward the Devil in the wilderness two and a half years earlier, and for good reason. Both the devil and Peter tried to keep Jesus from fulfilling his saving mission.

在此之前耶稣至少有一次谈过了他的死亡（约翰福音3:14）。然而这一次，彼得表示拒绝。彼得将耶稣叫到一遍，对耶稣说谈论他的死亡是不对的。耶稣回答说：“撒旦，退我后边去吧！”（马可福音8:33）。两年半前当耶稣在旷野中，耶稣直接面对魔鬼时说了同样的话。这样说有一个好的理由——魔鬼和彼得都试图拦阻耶稣完成他救赎的使命。

Jesus then went on to give a sermon to his disciples. He told them why Peter’s human point of view was wrong. “What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet lose his own soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for His soul?” (Mark 8:36-37).

接下来，耶稣继续训诫他的门徒们。他告诉他们为什么彼得这种人的想法是错的。“人就是赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢？人还能拿什么换生命呢？”（马可福音8:36-37）。

**The Transfiguration -- Luke 9:28-36**

**登山变像 -- 路加福音9：28-36**

Six days later Jesus’ closest disciples (Peter, James, and John) had an unforgettable experience. John later wrote concerning it "We have seen his [Jesus’] glory. . . (John 1:14). Peter wrote, “We were eyewitnesses of his majesty. . .” (2 Peter 1:16).

六天后，耶稣最亲近的门徒们（彼得，雅各和约翰）领受了一次难以忘怀的经历。约翰后来写到这经历的时候说：“我们也见过他（耶稣的）的荣光”（约翰福音1:14）。彼得则这样写道：“我们……亲眼见过他的威荣”（彼得后书1:16）。

As frequently was His custom, Jesus went up on a mountain to pray in the evening. This time he and his three disciples went up the side of a mountain, probably Mt. Hermon. As he climbed, Jesus thought about his own sufferings and death was on his mind.

 按耶稣惯常的习惯，他在早晨的时候上山祷告。这次他和他的三个门徒登到上，这山有可能是黑门山。一路上耶稣脑海里思想着他的苦难和死亡。

During the night while the disciples slept, Jesus’ divine nature which was usually invisible, suddenly showed itself.  Jesus began to glow like a great white light. While he was in this “transfigured” (changed) condition, Moses the lawgiver, and Elijah, the great prophet, joined him. They discussed together Jesus’ death. This event gave Jesus the comfort and strength he needed to continue on toward his death.

夜里门徒们都睡了，耶稣通常隐藏的神性突然显现。他开始发出极大的白色光芒。当他变了形象的时候，颁布律法的摩西和伟大的先知以利亚加入此列。他们一起讨论耶稣的死亡。他需继续面对他的死亡，这件事给耶稣带来安慰和力量。

While Jesus was transfigured the disciples woke up and saw him. Not knowing what to do or say, Peter suggested that he build little shelters for the glorious trio.

当耶稣变了形象的时候，他的门徒们醒了过来并看到他。彼得手足无措，随即建议说他可以为这荣耀的三位支搭帐篷。

We may wonder why only these three disciples were blessed with this experience, just as they had been singled out once before (Luke 8:51-56). Perhaps it was to help prepare them also for their later lives.  James would be the first disciple to die for his faith (Acts 12:2).  The knowledge of Jesus’ resurrection and this vision of glory must have given him strength during his own death! Peter was the most important missionary to the Jews.  He also would be put to death by ungodly men. The sight of the glorified Jesus made him bold to confess him as the Messiah (2 Peter 1:16-18). Finally, for John the transfiguration was a proof that Jesus was God (John 1:14), and it was a source of strength for him as well. He was the last disciple to die. While exiled to an island and separated from fellow believers, he could remember the glory which awaits the faithful, even the glory of Moses and Elijah (Rev. 1:9).

我们也许想知道为什么只是这三个门徒有福气经历此事，就像他们此前也有一次被挑选出来一样（路加福音8:51-56）。也许这也是帮助他们为稍后的生活做好准备。雅各将是第一个为了信心而死的门徒（使徒行传12:2）。耶稣复活的信息和这荣耀的显现，一定在他死亡的时候给了他莫大的力量。彼得是犹太人中最重要的使徒。他也会被异教徒杀死。充满荣耀的景象使他勇敢地宣告，耶稣就是弥赛亚（参看彼得后书1:16-18）。最后，对于约翰来说，登山变相证明了耶稣就是上帝（约翰福音1:14），这对于他来说同样是个力量的源泉。他是门徒中最后一个死的。当被放逐到海岛上，远离他的信徒们时，他能够回忆起那等候忠实者的荣耀，就像摩西和以利亚的荣耀一样（启示录1:9）。

**Jesus heals a boy with an evil spirit -- Luke 9:37-43a**

**耶稣医治被鬼附着的男孩 -- 路加福音9：37-43a**

The next morning, Jesus and his disciples quietly walked back down the mountain. At the bottom, however, they found a large crowd gathered.

第二天一早，耶稣和门徒们安静地下山返回。然而，在山脚的时候他们遇到一大群人聚集在那里。

Jesus soon learned that in the crowd was a poor young boy. He could not talk or hear; he had symptoms of epilepsy; and he was demon-possessed.  Furthermore, the disciples had not been able to help him.

耶稣马上知晓在人群中有一个可怜的青年。他听不见也无法说话，还伴随有癫痫的症状；他被鬼所附。同时，门徒们完全没有办法帮助他。

Jesus was angered by the merciless, miracle seeking crowd.  He had mercy on the father and his only son. As usual, Jesus strengthened the faith of the father and cured the boy.

耶稣因为这无情的、寻找神迹的人群激怒。他怜悯了这父亲和他的独生子。像往常一样，耶稣坚固了这个父亲的信心，并治愈了他的孩子。

**Jesus again predicts his death -- Luke 9:43b-45**

**耶稣再次预言自己的死 -- 路加福音9：43b-45**

As mentioned earlier, the death of John the Baptist was a turning point in Jesus’ life.  From then on Jesus became firmly convinced that soon he must suffer and die for the sins of man. Jesus continued to think about his suffering, death, and resurrection. After leaving the crowd and the healed boy behind, Jesus continued to teach the disciples about the sorrowful, yet glorious days ahead.

像之前提到过的，施洗约翰的死是耶稣生命中的一个转折点。从那时起耶稣开始坚信不久之后他必须受苦，并未所有罪人而死。耶稣不断地思想他的受苦、死亡和复活。当离开人群和被医治的男孩儿之后，耶稣继续教导他的门徒未来那充满忧伤，但是满有荣耀的日子。

**Jesus pays the temple tax -- Matthew 17:24-27**

**耶稣付圣殿税 -- 马太福音17：24-27**

Perhaps it was mid-September when Jesus and his disciples left the area of Caesarea Philippi. They traveled along the west side of the Sea of Galilee until they came to Capernaum. There Peter was met by a tax collector.

可能是在九月中旬，耶稣和他的门徒们离开了凯撒利亚腓立比地区。他们沿着加利利海的西侧前行，直到他们来到迦百农。在这里彼得与一个税吏相遇。

Every Jewish male over 20 years of age had to pay a tax each year to support the temple in Jerusalem (Exodus 30:12-16). While the tax was generally collected during the Passover festival, Peter and Jesus had not yet paid.

每一个年龄在20岁以上的犹太男性，每年必须支付税赋，以支持耶路撒冷的圣殿（出埃及记30:12-16）。虽然这项税赋通常在逾越节期间征收，彼得和耶稣都还没有缴纳。

Jesus showed how silly the situation was. A king’s subjects, not the king’s children, pay for the upkeep on the palace. The Jerusalem temple was God the Father’s house. Jesus was his Son, yet he was expected to pay the tax. Nevertheless, to obey the law, Jesus produced money for Peter and himself from the mouth of a fish.

耶稣表明这件事是多么的愚蠢。是国王的臣民们支付宫殿的维护保养的费用，而非国王的孩子们。耶路撒冷的圣殿是天父上帝的家。耶稣是上帝的儿子，然而人们希望他缴纳税赋。虽然如此，为了遵守法律，耶稣给彼得和他自己在一条鱼的嘴里“找到”了些钱。

**Who is the greatest? -- Luke 9:46-50; Matthew 18**

**谁最大？-- 路加福音9：46-50   马太福音18**

Jesus had withdrawn several times in order to think about his work and death. At the same time he wanted to continue teaching his disciples. Scripture describes some of the issues Jesus discussed with his disciples near the end of his fourth withdrawal. 

为了思想他的工作和死亡，耶稣已经多次远离人群。与此同时他希望不断地教导他的门徒们。在接近第四次“撤退”尾声时，经文中记载了一些耶稣与他的门徒们讨论的话题。

About who was most important.  The disciples debated “which of them would be the greatest” (Luke 9:46). The answer: a person becomes great by being humble, not by seeking glory for himself.

关于水最重要。门徒们争论“谁将为大”（路加福音9:46）。答案是：一个人的伟大是因为谦卑，而不是为自己谋求荣耀。

About true and false teachers. John noted “we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us” (Luke 9:49). The answer: service in Christ’s name, not a ranking with the apostles, is God-pleasing. 

关于真假师傅。约翰提示说：“我们看见一个人奉你的名赶鬼，我们就禁止他，因为他不与我们一同跟随你。”（路加福音9:49）。答案是：上帝所喜悦的是因着基督之名的服侍，而不是与使徒同列。

About giving offense.  Jesus gave a stern warning about giving offense and causing others to lose their faith. He also showed the foolishness of allowing temptations to continue, temptations which could cause a person to fall from faith.

关于冒犯。得罪人和使人失去信心的情况被耶稣严厉地警告。耶稣还展示了允许试探继续下去的愚蠢，试探会让一个人失去信心。

About the value of the individual.  Looking at a little child, Jesus spoke of the value of individual souls. The tiny child is important to God and must not be prevented from coming to him. The lost sheep must be returned to the sheep pen. How far should believers go to return a brother to the flock?  Jesus explained the proper steps in disciplining church members.

关于个人的价值。耶稣一边看着一个小孩子，一遍谈论每个灵魂的价值。一个幼小的孩子在上帝那里是重要的，一定不要阻止他到上帝那里去。丢失的羊一定要被带回羊圈。在什么范围内，信徒们应该将一个弟兄带回到到人群中呢？耶稣讲解了操练教会会众合适的步骤。

About forgiveness.  Peter asked how often he should forgive someone who sinned against him. Jesus answered: always. Speaking in a parable Christ taught Peter that when the issue of forgiving someone arises he should remember the debt God has forgiven him.

关于宽恕。彼得问道，，他应该饶恕那得罪了他的人多少次。耶稣回答说：永远饶恕。通过一个比喻基督教导彼得，当每一次他饶恕别人时，他应该想起他的债都已被上帝免除了。
