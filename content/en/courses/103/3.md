In the last chapter we started our look at Jesus’ first year of ministry. It was a year in which Jesus moved from being unknown to well-known.  During the next three months (January through March of A.D. 28) Jesus carried on an active ministry among the people of Galilee. Most people received him favorably, but at the same time some opposition began to appear.

在上一章中，我们开始了解耶稣的第一年事工。这一年他从不被人们认识到被熟知。在接下来的三个月（公园28年1月到3月）耶稣继续在加利利一代公开传道。大多数人愿意接受他，但同时一些反对者也开始出现。

**John is put in prison by Herod -- Luke 3:19, 20    Matthew 14:3-5**

**约翰被希律监禁 -- 路加福音3:19,20     马太福音14：3-5**

Meanwhile, John also spoke the truth. He spoke the truth to a powerful person.  That person was Herod.  That truth was Herod’s sinful marriage. Herod opposed John.

与此同时，约翰也讲了真相。 他向一个有权势的人说实话。 那个人是希律王。这个真相指的是希律王罪恶的婚姻。 希律王反对约翰。

This Herod was one of the sons of Herod the Great. We know him as Herod Antipas. Herod Antipas had divorced his own wife in order to marry his brother’s wife. Her name was Herodias. According to Josephus, the 1st century historian, Herod locked John up in prison near Machaerus.  Machaerus was a military fortress located along the northeast corner of the Dead Sea.

希律王是希律大帝的儿子之一，被称为希律安提帕斯。 为了娶他兄弟的妻子希罗底，希律安提帕与妻子离婚。根据1世纪历史学家约瑟夫斯的说法，希律王将约翰下在马查鲁斯附近的监狱里。 马查鲁斯是位于死海东北角的军事要塞。

John did not leave this prison alive.  After a long imprisonment, Herod ordered John to be executed.

约翰没有活着离开这座监狱。 经过长期监禁后，希律王下令处决约翰。

Jesus talks with the Samaritan Woman -- John 4:1-32 耶稣与撒马利亚女人交谈 -- 约翰福音4：1-32

Some people think the events of Jesus’ early ministry happened mostly by accident.  This, however, is not true. When Jesus left heaven and became human, he already had a clear picture of the saving work he had to do.  So from the very beginning all of his traveling, deeds and teaching were done just to carry out that ministry.

有些人认为耶稣早期的传道大多是偶然发生的。然而事实并非如此。当耶稣离开天堂并成为人类时，对于他必须要做的拯救就已经有了清晰的蓝图。所以从最开始，他所有的活动、行为、教导都只是为了完成那项使命。

Jesus began his public ministry in Jerusalem, the center of Old Testament worship. By cleansing the temple he showed himself to be the Lord of the temple, the long awaited Messiah. Throughout Judea John the Baptist had already preached against the false teachings (heresy) of the Jewish religious leaders.  Now Jesus came proclaiming the true gospel of salvation.

耶稣从耶路撒冷开始公开传道，这是旧约中敬拜的中心。通过洁净圣殿，他向人们显示了自己是圣殿的主人，是人们一直期待降临的弥赛亚。在真个犹太地区，施洗约翰已经公开反对犹太教领袖的错误教导（异端）。现在耶稣来宣告救赎的真正福音。

The Old Testament prophecies foretold that the Messiah would come to the Jews, but not to the Jews only (Is. 42:6; 49:6). As Simeon said, Jesus was to be the “glory of his people Israel” but also “a light for revelation to the Gentiles” (Luke 2:32). Thus, after beginning his work among the Israelites, Jesus set out for the Jewish province of Galilee. First, however, he paused in the Gentile region of Samaria.

旧约先知预言弥赛亚要来到犹太人中间，但并不仅限于犹太人（赛42：6；49:6）。正如西门所言，耶稣是“以色列民的荣耀”，也是“照亮外邦人的光”（路2:32）。因此，耶稣在以色列人中开始事工之后，出发到了加利利的犹太人聚集区。然而他首先在外邦人撒马利亚停留了一下。

Most Jews traveling north from Judea felt it was necessary to avoid Samaria. Some seven centuries earlier Israelites had lived in this area, then called Samaria. However, when the Assyrians conquered the area, they deported many of the Jews and replaced them with pagan peoples (2 Kings 17). Soon the Jews who were still living in Samaria began intermarrying with the unbelievers. As a result, their true religion was mixed with false beliefs.

大多数从犹太地向北移居的犹太人感觉有必要避开撒马利亚人。大约在7世纪早期以色列人居住在这个地区，后来称作撒马利亚。然而当亚述人攻克这地时，他们驱逐出了很多犹太人，取而代之的是非基督徒（列下17）。很快仍然居住在撒马利亚的犹太人开始于不信的人通婚。同样他们的真信仰也很快与其他错误的信仰混合。

In Jesus’ day the Samaritan’s Bible was made up of the first five books of the Old Testament.  They worshiped Jehovah, but also they allowed pagan beliefs and idols. Their center of worship was the top of Mt. Gerizim, not the temple in Jerusalem. Consequently, the Jews looked down on the Samaritans.  And the Samaritans in turn hated the Jews.

在耶稣时代撒马利亚人的圣经由旧约的前五卷组成。他们也敬拜耶和华，但他们也润需异教徒和拜偶像。他们崇拜的中心在基利心山的山顶，而不在耶路撒冷的圣殿。因此，犹太人轻看撒马利亚人。而撒马利亚人转而憎恨犹太人。

But Jesus would not take part in ethnic hatred. Jesus viewed the Samaritans just as he did the Jews.  All were sinners in need of a savior. Interestingly, he chose a very sinful woman to evangelize on this trip.

但是耶稣不参与种族仇恨。在他眼中撒马利亚人和犹太人一样都是需要拯救的罪人。有趣的是，在这次旅途中，他选择了一个罪孽深重的妇人作为传福音的对象。

When we look closely, we can see Jesus’ excellent evangelism skills with the woman at the well. He made her curious, making her interested in something she didn’t have (John 4:4-15). Next, he revealed her sins to her and encouraged her to confess her guilt (vv. 16-19). Finally, avoiding an argument about worship methods, he told her he was the Messiah, the true and living God (vv 20-26).  

当我们更严密地看这段经文时，会发现耶稣在给这位井边的妇人传福音时，显示出了优秀的传福音技巧。耶稣让她好奇、让她对自己所没有的事情感兴趣（约4:4-15）。接下来他指出她得罪并鼓励她认罪（16-19节）。最后，为了避免有关敬拜方式的真论，他告诉那妇人他就是弥赛亚，那真正的、活生生的上帝（20-26节）。

The Samaritan woman’s faith produced immediate fruits. She went to the people she knew and talked about the Savior. They came to Jesus, perhaps out of curiosity, but then believed his word of eternal life. Within two days many souls were saved.

这撒马利亚妇人的信心很快结出了果子。她到认识的人们那里跟他们谈论救世主。他们就来到耶稣面前，也许出于好奇心，但随后便信了他关于永生的话。两天之内很多灵魂得救了。

**Jesus preaches in Galilee -- Luke 4:14,15    John 4:43-45**

**耶稣在加利利传道 -- 路加福音4：14,15    约翰福音4：43-45**

From Samaria Jesus and his disciples traveled north toward Galilee. Along the way Jesus let the disciples return to their homes and former occupations. Perhaps Jesus also spent some time resting after his first year of preaching.

离开撒马利亚，耶稣和他的门徒向北往加利利去。沿途耶稣让门徒回家或者从事以前的职业。也许在第一年的布道生活结束之后，耶稣也像花点时间休息一下。

However, Jesus was not to enjoy much rest and quiet. Many of the Galileans who earlier had seen him perform miracles in Jerusalem now recognized him.  Soon news of his presence spread throughout Galilee.

然而，耶稣并没有充分地休息和安静一下。很多初期在耶路撒冷见过他行神迹的加利利人认出了他。耶稣来到加利利的消息很快就传开了。

**Jesus heals the official’s son	-- John 4:43-54**

**耶稣治愈大臣的儿子  -- 约翰福音4：43-54**

In Cana Jesus was met by a certain nobleman whose son was sick. This man, possibly the man called Cuza in Luke 8:3, begged Jesus to come to Capernaum and to heal the youth. The nobleman had a weak faith, one based on seeing miracles and not on the Word of Jesus Christ. The Lord knew this, so he sent him home with nothing but a word of hope and the promise, “You may go. Your son will live” (John 4:50). The nobleman believed, went home, and found his son healed. He and his entire household came to faith that day.

在迦拿耶稣见了一个大臣，他的儿子病了。这个大臣可能是路加福音8:3中提到的叫苦撒的人，他祈求耶稣到迦百农医治他儿子。这大臣信心小，而且他的信心基于想要看到神迹而不是耶稣基督的话语。主知道这点，所以他只给了大臣希望和承诺的话语，就打发大臣空手回家去了。“回去吧！你的儿子活了”（约4:50）。这大臣信了，回到家中，发现他儿子已经痊愈了。那日他和全家人都信了。

**BACKGROUND 背景**

From January through March of A.D. 28 Jesus worked in his own backyard, Galilee. However, when the time for the Passover came, once again he made the trip to Jerusalem. As Jesus preached and healed in Jerusalem other Jews were having heated discussions about Jesus. In his teachings and actions Jesus was questioning the center of the corrupted Jewish religion -- obeying the Old Testament Sabbath laws in their smallest details while forgetting their meaning and purpose.  By obeying the laws in this way, they thought that they were doing good works that would earn their salvation.  

从公元28年的1月到3月，耶稣在自己的后院——加利利开展传道等事工。然而，逾越节到了，他又要去耶路撒冷了。因为耶稣在耶路撒冷讲道、医治病人，其他的犹太人热烈地讨论耶稣。耶稣在他的教导和行动中质疑腐坏的犹太教的中心问题——在每个细节中都遵循旧约的安息日律法，而忘记了安息日的真正含义和目的。通过这种方式遵循律法，他们认为是为了得到救赎而做好的事情。

**Jesus in Jerusalem for the Feast (of the Passover) -- John 5:1**

**耶稣在耶路撒冷参加（逾越节）筵席 -- 约翰福音5：1**

It is not certain that the Feast mentioned here is the Passover. It might have been Pentecost or Tabernacles. John mentions the Passover by name three times (John 2:13; 23; 6:4; 11:55). The outline we are following in this course is based on the conclusion that this Feast (John 5:1) was the Passover.

这里提到的筵席不确定是否逾越节筵席。它可能是五旬节或住棚节。约翰三次提到逾越节（约翰福音2:13; 23; 6：4; 11:55）。本课程中遵循的大纲是基于这个节日（约翰福音5：1）是逾越节的结论。

**Jesus heals a man at Bethesda’s Pool	-- John 5:2-15**

**耶稣在毕士大池子旁治愈了一个人 -- 约翰福音5：2-15**

After three months of busy mission work, Jesus briefly stopped his ministry to travel to Jerusalem for the Passover. While he was in Jerusalem, he went to the pool of Bethesda. The sight must have made him sad. Here a great number of sick and diseased people had gathered beneath the shaded porches. From time to time, God would send an angel to stir the waters of the pool.  The first person who stepped into the pool was then cured of his disease.

在忙碌的三个月传道之后，耶稣暂时停止讲道，去耶路撒冷过逾越节。在耶路撒冷时，耶稣去了毕士大池。池边的景象一定让耶稣伤心了。大量的生病的和残疾的人聚集在有阴凉的柱子下面。上帝偶尔会差派天使搅动池子里的水。第一个踏进池子里的人，病就得医治。

As Jesus looked at the blind, lame and paralyzed, he gave his attention to one person in particular. Through his divine knowledge Jesus knew that this man had been paralyzed for 38 years (longer than the average life expectancy at that time). Not only was this man very crippled, but he was also severely depressed.  Since he was unable to pull himself into the water after the angel's visit, he had no hope of being cured.

耶稣看到瞎眼的、瘸腿的、瘫痪的，同时他的注意到了一个特别的人。凭借天赐的知识，耶稣知道这个人已经瘫痪38年了（这在当时要比平均寿命的期望值还高）。这人不仅瘫痪得严重，而且非常沮丧。既然在天使光临之后，他无法把自己扔进水里，所以他无望得到医治。

Moved to help, Jesus approached the man and asked what seemed to be a silly question, “Do you want to get well?” (John 5:6). This question, however, was Jesus’ way of offering help. The crippled man answered that it was impossible for him to be healed unless someone put him in the water at the right moment. Jesus did not respond to this but simply commanded, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” At once the man was cured.  He picked up his mat and walked (John 5:8-9).

耶稣感到了，想要帮助他，预示耶稣接近他，问了他一个看上去很傻的问题：“你要痊愈吗？”（约5：6）。然而这问题正是耶稣要提供帮助的方式。那人回答说除非有人在合适的时候把他丢进水里，否则他不可能痊愈。耶稣对比没有回应，只是简单地命令到：“起来，拿你的褥子走吧。”那人立刻就痊愈了，就拿起褥子来走了（约5:8-9）。

Note two things about this miracle. First think what great power it showed. For 38 years this man had been paralyzed, but after one statement from Christ he was fully restored to normal health. His almost dead muscles were made strong, and immediately he was able to walk. Secondly, there is no evidence that this man believed in Jesus before this meeting. Nevertheless, God filled his heart with trust so that at Christ’s command, he tried to do the impossible -- to move muscles he could not feel or control.  

在这个神奇中我们要注意两点。首先，想想这显明了什么样的伟大力量。这人已经瘫痪38年，但由基督一句声明之后，他竟然完全恢复成了正常的健康人。他那几乎坏死的肌肉强壮有力，而且立刻就能走了。第二，在遇到耶稣之前没有证据表明这人是信耶稣的。尽管如此，上帝让信充满他的心，以至于基督发出命令时，他试着去做看似不可能的事——移动他无法感知和控制的肌肉。

The man was healed and later he worshiped God in the temple. There Jesus gave him a word of warning, “Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you” (John 5:14). In an instant Jesus showed the man the sins of his past, showed him forgiveness, and warned him of eternal damnation.

这人痊愈后就到圣殿中敬拜上帝。在圣殿里耶稣给他一句警告：“不要再犯罪，恐怕你遭遇的更加利害”（约5:14）。耶稣立即向他显明他此前的罪、他得救赎，也警告他不要犯罪而落入永久的地狱之中。

**Jewish leaders persecute Jesus -- John 5:16-47**

**犹太领袖迫害耶稣 -- 约翰福音5：16-47**

Some people immediately became upset by Jesus’ show of compassion and power. This was because he had performed this miracle on the Sabbath Day. The importance of resting on the Sabbath went back to God's creation of the world. God created for six days and then rested on the seventh (Genesis 2:2-3). Later God declared in the Third Commandment that the Sabbath was to be kept holy (Exodus 20:8-11). Still later God repeated that work was not to be done on this day (Nehemiah 13:15; Jeremiah 17:21). 

耶稣显明了自己的怜悯和大能，这立刻让一些人心烦意乱起来。这是因为耶稣在安息日行了神迹。在安息日休息的重要性可以追溯到上帝创造世界。上帝用六天创造世界，第七天歇了一切的工（创2:2-3）。后来上帝在第三项戒律中宣告将安息日守为圣日（出20:8-11）。后来上帝重复强调这日不可做工（尼13:15；耶17:21）。

What did the Old Testament mean when it commanded rest on the Sabbath day?  First of all, it meant people should rest from their normal daily work. People were not to carry anything to or from their fields, or bring anything into the city to be sold. In the second place the Sabbath was to be a symbol of the spiritual rest which would come through the promised Messiah (cf. Matthew 11:28-29). While awaiting the Savior, the people were to use the Sabbath to think about God’s many blessings, to worship him, to praise him, and to study his Word.

旧约要求人们在安息日休息是什么意思呢？首先，表示人们应该从日常工作中退出来休息。不得带东西出入田中，或者带东西去城里卖。其次，安息日是那由弥赛亚带来的灵魂休息的标志（太11:28-29）。在等待救世主到来期间，人们通过安息日思考上帝的诸多祝福，敬拜他，称颂他，学习他的话语。

Unfortunately, by Jesus’ time, the true meaning of the Sabbath had been lost. To the Pharisees the Sabbath meant obeying a long list of laws and rules. They invented laws to control how much a person could lift on the Sabbath, and how much he could eat and drink. The laws became silly. One said that on the Sabbath a person could go outdoors wearing two shoes, but to go walking with only one was breaking the law. On the Sabbath a man could carry a loaf of bread, but two men might not carry it between them.

不幸的是，在耶稣的时代，安息日的真正意义已经没有了。对于法利赛人来说，安息日意味着遵守长长的、一系列的律法和规则。他们自己创造律法，控制一个人在安息日可以拿多少东西，以及可以吃喝多少。律法在此变得很愚蠢。有人说再安息日一个人可以穿着两双鞋出门，但如果穿着一床鞋子去散步就违反律法了。在安息日一个人可以带一片面包，但是两个人之间不能带。

In the eyes of the jealous Pharisees Jesus had twice broken the Sabbath. First, he had done work on the Sabbath by healing the paralyzed man. Secondly, he had ordered the man to work by carrying his bed home. Thus began a serious struggle between the Lord of the Sabbath, Jesus Christ, and those who had corrupted the Sabbath, the religious leaders of the people.

在留心提防的法利赛人眼中，耶稣两次违反了安息日的律法。第一次，他在安息日做工，医治了瘫痪的人。第二次，他命令这个瘫子拿着自己的床回家。因此，在安息日的主——耶稣基督和那些已经破坏了安息日原本意义的宗教领袖之间，开始了一场严肃的征战。

The Jewish leaders now accused Jesus of breaking the Sabbath law. If he was found guilty, he should have been killed; the people should throw stones at him until he was dead (Numbers 15:32-36). Jesus gave a logical and spiritual defense. He argued that God the Father worked every day for mankind, so naturally the Son of God also works on the Sabbath. To the Jews this statement was blasphemous. Jesus was making himself equal to God.

现在犹太教的领导者职责耶稣违反安息日律法。如果发现他有罪，他应该已经被杀死，人们应该朝他扔石头知道打死他（民15:32-36）。对此耶稣给出了合乎逻辑、属灵的防卫。他表明天父上帝每一天都为人做工，所以上帝的儿子自然也要在安息日做工。对于犹太人来说，这样的言辞陈述是对上帝的亵渎。耶稣是在把自己等同于上帝。

Jesus is equal to God. He argued that this equality was his Father’s doing. The Father put into Jesus’ hands the matters of life and death and judgment. Thus, he deserved equal honor with the Father. On the other hand, “He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him” (John 5:23). The Jews did not have to take Jesus' word for this. John, a man moved by God, testified concerning Jesus as did the Father himself. All of Scripture testifies that Jesus is God’s Son. But the Jews did not listen to Jesus’ words.

耶稣确实是等同于上帝。他坚持说这种等同性是他父亲所设定的。上帝将生死和审判的事交托在耶稣手中。因此，他配得与上帝一样的荣耀，另一方面，“不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差他来的父。”（约5:23）。犹太人不必相信耶稣的这番话。而约翰，被上帝感召的人，为此做了见证，正如天父自己所说的一样。所有经文都证明了耶稣是上帝的儿子。但是犹太人不听耶稣的这些话。

After the Passover the Lord returned and resumed his ministry in Galilee. There the complaints were drowned out by the cries of hope and praise. Crowds gathered around the “Good Doctor” to receive help for their illnesses. But Jesus, as he showed in the Sermon on the Mount, had come to give spiritual relief.

逾越节之后，主又回到加利利，重新开始公开传道。在加利利，抱怨的声音被希望和赞美之声淹没。人群都聚集在“好医生”周围，为了他们的病能得到医治。但是正如耶稣在山上的布道中显明的，他来是安慰灵魂的。
