## Course Description/Objective

Wherever we look in this world, we find people in desperate need of help. This course is the first part in a series which goal is to provide Christians with an overview of the variety of issues that people may face as they remind others of God’s redeeming love in Christ (Psalm 34:18 – The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit). Christian Counseling, Part 1 primarily focuses on cognitive/mood disorders as addressed in Scripture. Part 2 will emphasis family structure disorders. A course listing of these topics is provided elsewhere in this material.

## The objective of this course is to provide a resource for others in a Christian counseling ministry. It will help you to

1. Understand and accurately assess a person’s struggle;

2. Guide discussion and provide helpful suggestions;

3. Remember key principles in the process of moving people from problem to resolution;

4. Lay the foundation of God’s Word, so that proper use of law and gospel directs the counseling setting.

## The teaching format will provide a collaborative learning experience, which focuses on the following goals of touching the head, heart, and hands of the learner. Since all learning is meant to affect the intellect, emotion, and volition this will be the teaching philosophy of this course

Each topic will generally be divided into an outlined format as follows:

1. Case Study – Every topic begins with an example that relates a story about people struggling with a particular issue.

2. Key Terms – Important definitions will be provided, so that the student will have a better understanding of the issue under discussion.

3. Causes/Character – A series of statement or questions are provided to help the student understand a particular struggle. These are also used to help determine if referral to a physician or other professional is necessary.

4. Counseling Advice– Students will learn to structure their counseling so that biblical concepts are applied in the most helpful way.

5. Steps to Follow – These steps will give the student an idea of how to identify the problem and bring it to resolution in a counseling setting.

6. Light on the Path – Bible passages and brief commentary will aid the student in learning how to place a counseling session into a biblical framework, so the power of the Holy Spirit offers true, spiritual direction.

7. Some Mindful Questions – these are questions that a counselor may ask as part of an in-take interview or simply as a Christian friend talking with another friend about a struggle. These are meant to be “open” and “closed” questions so as to expose the student to information-gathering questions, which encourage further, deeper discussion about the situation.

8. Now, It’s Your Turn – Students are given an opportunity to apply the principles discussed in each lesson to the case studies that are provided. This allows the student to gain practical experience as well as to apply collaborative learning in the class setting.

*Please note that not every lesson will follow this outline exactly.
