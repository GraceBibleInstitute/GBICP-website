THE MESSIAH IN THE WRITINGS

“Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” (Luke 24:44–45) 

The Psalm section of the Hebrew Old Testament actually includes more than just the book of Psalms: Job, Ruth, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and Lamentations. This third section is sometimes called “the Writings.”

Lesson 9 = The Messiah Does God’s Will (Psalm 40)

Lesson 10 = The Messiah is Crucified (Psalm 22)

Lesson 11 = The Messiah is the Risen Lord (Psalm 16)

Lesson 12 = The Messiah is the King of Glory (Psalms 2 and 110)

DIRECT AND INDIRECT MESSIANIC PROPHECY

Direct Messianic prophecy. This is when the prophecy has only one possible fulfillment in Christ. Prophecy ---> Christ  Examples: the virgin birth in Isaiah 7:14 or Christ’s resurrection in Psalm 16:10 “You will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your holy one see decay.” Those prophecies can be referring to no one other than Jesus. 
Indirect Messianic prophecy.  This is when the passage may be about two future events – an early partial or incomplete fulfillment (an event or person) and the ultimate, final, greater fulfillment in Christ. Prophecy ---> Type ---> Christ.  Example: David will have a son who will build God’s house (2 Samuel 7:1-16). Solomon is the intermediate fulfillment, but the great fulfillment is in Christ (Prophet 🡪 Solomon 🡪 Christ)

THE MESSIAH IN PSALM 40

6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require. 7 Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll. 8 I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.” (Psalm 40:6-8)

Psalm 40:6-8

Hebrews 10:5-6

6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require. 


“Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; 6 with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.

7 Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll. 8 I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.”
 “Then I said, ‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll— I have come to do your will, O God.” 

Who wrote Psalm 40 according to the superscription?


According to verse 6, what was not pleasing to God? 



What was not pleasing about those things? Didn’t God specify that they should be done in the laws of Moses?




What is the meaning of the phrase “my ears you have pierced” in verse 6? 




What scroll is this in verse 7? Is this the scroll of the Torah (the Law of Moses in the first 5 books of the Old Testament) or the entire Old Testament?



What is the meaning of “your law is within my heart” in verse 8?




But what about verse 12? Doesn’t that verse apply to someone other than the Messiah?





What do we learn about the Messiah from this Psalm?







Next week we will continue to look at the amazing Messianic psalms. We will focus on Psalm 22, sometimes called “the Holy of Holies of the Messianic psalms.”
