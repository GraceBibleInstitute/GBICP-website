SCHEDULE

 These text studies were prepared in the hope that two studies could be covered in a single class period. Therefore, it is hoped that all 60 Gospel texts could be covered in 30 lessons. 

 A GBI semester consists of about 15 weeks, so half of the text studies could be covered in one semester. All 60 text studies would require two semesters.
