HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW

    Last time we considered two steps involved in conversion:

1) By the law God works the knowledge of sin and sorrow over sin in the human heart.

2) The Holy Spirit calls people to faith by the Gospel.

    Today let’s consider a third step involved in conversion:

3) By working faith in the heart the Holy Spirit also gives certain spiritual gifts.

When the Gospel is effective it works faith in the heart.

1 Thess 2:13

2 Tim 1:9

1 Pet 2:9

2 Cor 4:6

Phil 1:29

Rom 10:17

We need to distinguish between intellectual and spiritual knowledge.

Rom 10:14

Ps 119:37

Spiritual knowledge is faith.

1 Cor 1:23-24

Eph 2:5-6

1 Pet 2:25

John 6:37

Conversion brings about an instantaneous change.

Lk 11:23

A person remains converted as long as he has faith.

1 Jn 5:1

Lk 8:13

Lk 22:32

2 Cor 13:5

Heb 11:6

The Holy Spirit causes intellectual knowledge to work spiritual knowledge.

Mk 4:27

Acts 22:6-11

2 Cor 13:5

1 Jn 3:14
