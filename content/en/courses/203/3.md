HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT REVIEW

LESSON 3 Lecture

The Holy Spirit works conversion in the human heart. What three things does He do?

1)

2)

3)

Step One

By the law God works the knowledge of sin and sorrow over sin in the human heart.

Mt 9:12

Rom 3:20

Gal 3:10

2 Cor 7:10

Rom 7:24,25

The Law can only cause a person to be sorrowful and to despair.

Step Two

The Holy Spirit calls people to faith by the Gospel.

Mk 16:15

Lk 14:17

Is 55:3

Is 44:22

Mt 11:28

This invitation is:

1) Free

    Is 55:1

2) Universal

    Mk 16:15

    Lk 24:47

    Rev 14:6

3) Sincere

    Rom 10:21

    Mt 23:37  

4) Efficacious

    Heb 4:12

    Rom 1:16

    2 Tim 3:15

When the Gospel is not effective it is not because of any lack of sincerity on God’s part or lack of power in the Gospel but only because people reject it.

Mt 23:37

Acts 7:51  

Conversion can be frustrated by man’s self-righteousness, his love of sin, his pride, and his despair.
