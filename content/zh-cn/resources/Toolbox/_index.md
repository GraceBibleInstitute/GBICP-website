Suggestions and Instructions for Toolbox

这个资料工具包的设计与耶稣在马太福音28:18-20中讲的大使命一致：“耶稣进前来，对他们说，天上地下所有的权柄，都赐给我了。所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。”

This tool box of materials is intended to go along with Jesus’s words in the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18-20. 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

本工具包分为四个部分：1、布道，2、门徒信徒，3、培养领袖，4、开展新聚会点。你可能在其中一个部分里找到可能对另一个部分有帮助的资料。在一个人成为带领之前，他必须先接受训练，学习成为基督徒的基础知识。一个基督教门徒，首先应该要知道“如何过祷告的生活、虔诚的生活”，而后应该要知道“如何在他们的家庭和社群成为一个属灵的带领”。一些相关资料可以在“第三部分门徒信徒”中找到。

This toolkit is split into four sections: 1. Reach out, 2. Disciple Believers, 3. Train Leaders, 4. Multiply Groups. You may find material in one section that may help in another section as well. Before someone can become a leader, they must first be discipled and learn the basics of what it is to be Christian. A disciple of Christ should first know how to have a prayer life, a devotional life and how to be a spiritual leader in their home and community. Some of these materials are found in Section 3: Disciple Believers.

本工具包旨在辅助督导和训练。虽然其中一些资料可以通过自学来消化，但如果目前的带领能和新基督徒或发展中的带领一起过一遍这些资料，那是最好的。这会增进你们的关系并帮助坚固新基督徒或带领的信心。我们鼓励你们不要把工具包只是给到对方，然后让他们在没有任何指导或帮助的情况下自己琢磨。我们鼓励你们与信徒一起用这个工具包，来训练他们。让工具包成为你督导他人、增进信徒关系的一种方式。

This toolkit is meant to assist in mentoring and training. While some of this material could be done as self-study, it is best if a current leader can walk a new Christian or developing leader through the material. This will increase your relationship and help build confidence in the new Christian or leader. The encouragement is to not just give this tool box to someone and let them figure it all out by themselves without any guidance or help. We encourage you to work together train believers using this toolbox. Let this toolbox be a way for you to mentor others and strengthen relationships of discipling.  

目的是将人与耶稣、福音和圣经中的真理连接起来，在他们的信仰中建立每个人。耶稣给了我们教会和一个信徒家庭一起踏上这段旅程。愿这资料佑助你们，成为一个以基督为首的、具备诸多能力和功用的基督教家庭，成为信众的身体。

The goal is to connect people to Jesus, the Gospel, and the truth found in Scripture to build each person up in their faith. Jesus gave us the church and a family of believers to make this journey together. May this material bless you as you grow as a Christian family, the body of believers, with many parts and functions and Christ as the head.
