We’ve seen how our salvation is entirely dependent on God.  Jesus Christ is the one who made the complete payment for our sins.  The Holy Spirit is the one who creates saving faith in our hearts.  But where do our good works play into all this?  That is the focus of our final key concept – works.  Here are the questions we need to answer in this lesson:

• What part do good works play in our salvation?

• Why do we do good works?

• How do we do good works?

• What guidance does God give to help us learn what he considers “good”?

我们已经看到我们的拯救完全依靠上帝。耶稣基督为我们赎了所有的罪。圣灵在我们的心里创造拯救信心。但是我们的好行为在这其中起什么作用呢？这就是最后一个关键概念的聚焦――好行为。如下是我们这课中需要回答的问题：

• 好行为在我们的拯救中起什么作用？

• 我们为什么行善？

• 我们如何行善？

• 上帝给我们什么指引来帮助我们学习什么是上帝所认为的“好”？

WHAT PART DO GOOD WORKS PLAY IN OUR SALVATION?

好行为在我们的拯救中起什么作用？

Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.

请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。

Romans 3:28 – We maintain that a man is justified (declared “not guilty”) by faith apart from observing the law.

罗马书3:28－－人称义（宣称“无罪”）是因着信，不在乎遵行律法。

Ephesians 2:8-9 – For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith – and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God – not by works, so that no one can boast.

以弗所书2:8-9－－你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。

Romans 11:5-6 – So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.  And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.

罗马书11:5-6－－如今也是这样，照着拣选的恩典，还有所留的余数。既是出于恩典，就不在乎行为；不然，恩典就不是恩典了。

Romans 9:30 – The Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.  Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works.

罗马书9:30－－那本来不追求义的外邦人反得了义，就是因信而得的义。但以色列人追求律法的义，反得不着律法的义。这是什么缘故呢？是因为他们不凭着信心求，只凭着行为求。

Galatians 5:4 – You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.

加拉太书5:4－－你们这要靠律法称义的，是与基督隔绝，从恩典中坠落了。

1. On the basis of these passages, if you were to fill in percentages for how much our salvation is dependant on God’s grace and how much is dependent on our good works, what would those percentages be?

    基于上述经文，如果让你来填写我们的拯救有多少是基于上帝的恩典，有多少是基于我们的好行为，其比例是什么？

    Our salvation is __100_____% God’s grace and __0_____% our good works.

    我们的拯救是上帝_______%的恩典和我们_______%的好行为。

2. What do those passages say happens if someone tries to earn salvation on their own, by relying on their own good works? (Look at the underlined portions of those passages.)

    如果某人试着靠自己博得拯救，靠着他们自己的好行为，将会发生什么事情？（参看上述经文划线部分。）

    A person who tries to earn salvation on their own by their good works will never attain salvation.

    On the basis of those passages, how would you answer that question, “WHAT PART DO GOOD WORKS PLAY IN OUR SALVATION?”

    基于上述经文，如何回答问题“好行为在我们的拯救中起什么作用？”

    Our good works play not part in our salvation.

    We have used the word “justification” (or “justify”) a number of times.  It came up above in Romans 3:28 and Galatians 5:4.  We defined this as “a legal term which means to declare someone ‘not guilty’ of sin.”  It’s important to remember that our salvation is just that – a declaration of God that he makes in light of Christ’s death and resurrection.  

    我们已经多次使用了“称义”这个词。在上述经文罗马书3:28以及加拉太书5:4又出现了。我们定义这个为“一个法律词汇，其意思是宣称某人是‘无罪’的”。我们的拯救就是上帝因着基督的死亡和复活所做的一个宣言，牢记这一点很重要。

    WHY DO WE DO GOOD WORKS?

    我们为什么行善？

    Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.

    请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。

    Psalm 56:4 – In God I trust; I will not be afraid.

    诗篇56:4－－我倚靠神，必不惧怕。

    1 John 4:19 – We love because he first loved us.

    约翰一书4:19－－我们爱，因为神先爱我们。

    2 Corinthians 5:14-15 – For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.  And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.

    哥林多后书5:14-15－－原来基督的爱激励我们；因我们想，一人既替众人死，众人就都死了；并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。

    Galatians 2:20 – I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

    加拉太书2:20－－我已经与基督同钉十字架，现在活着的不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着；并且我如今在肉身活着，是因信神的儿子而活；他是爱我，为我舍己。

    Romans 12:1 – Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God – which is your spiritual worship.

    罗马书12:1 －－所以弟兄们，我以神的慈悲劝你们，将身体献上，当作活祭，是圣洁的，是神所喜悦的；你们如此事奉乃是理所当然的。

3. Psalm 56:4 gives one reason for trying to do good works that has been removed from our life.  What motivator to do good works has been removed from the life of the Christian?

    诗篇56:4把我们生活里一个试着去行善的原因拿走了。基督徒生活中什么样的行善动机被拿走了？

    The motivation of fear as a reason to do good works have been removed from our life.

    Christians have a different motivation.  On the basis of those passages, how would you answer that question, “WHY DO WE DO GOOD WORKS?”  (Look at the italicized portions of those passages.)

    基督徒有一个不一样的动机。基于上述经文，如何回答问题“我们为什么行善？”（参看上述经文斜体部分。）

    Christians do good works out of love for the God who loves us and has saved us.

    HOW DO WE DO GOOD WORKS?

    我们如何行善？

    Romans 8:7 – The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.

    罗马书8:7－－原来体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇；因为不服神的律法，也是不能服。

    Galatians 5:17 – The sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.

    加拉太书5:17－－因为情欲和圣灵相争，圣灵和情欲相争，这两个是彼此相敌，使你们不能做所愿意做的。

    Romans 7:18-19 – I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.  For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do – this I keep on doing.

    罗马书7:18-19－－我也知道在我里头，就是我肉体之中，没有良善。因为，立志为善由得我，只是行出来由不得我。故此，我所愿意的善，我反不做；我所不愿意的恶，我倒去做。

4. Do we have the power, on our own, to do good works? (Look at the italicized portions of those verses.)

    我们自己有力量来行善吗？（参看上述经文斜体部分。）

    We do not have the natural ability or power to do good works.

5. Why? (Look at the underlined portions of those verses.)

    为什么？（参看上述经文划线部分。）

    By nature, all we have is a sinful nature.  Our sinful nature is spiritual unwilling and unable to do the good God requires.

    Ephesians 2:10 – For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

    以弗所书2:10－－我们原是他的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是神所预备叫我们行的。

    Philippians 2:13 – …for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.

    腓立比书2:13－－…因为你们立志行事都是神在你们心里运行，为要成就他的美意。

    2 Corinthians 9:8 – And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.

    哥林多后书9:8－－神能将各样的恩惠多多的加给你们，使你们凡事常常充足，能多行各样善事。

    Titus 2:11-12 – For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.  It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age.

    提多书2:11-12－－因为神救众人的恩典已经显明出来，教训我们除去不敬虔的心和世俗的情欲，在今世自守、公义、敬虔度日。

6. Why are we able to do good works? (Look at the italicized portions of those verses.)

    为什么我们能够行善？（参看上述经文斜体部分。）

    God gives us the desires and power to do good works.

7. We said that God gets the credit for the forgiveness of sins.  We said that he gets the credit for our faith.  Would you have to say the same thing about our good works?

    罪获赦免，我们说上帝得赞扬。相信耶稣，我们也说上帝得赞扬。对我们的好行为，你会有同样的说法吗？

    Yes.  God also gives us everything we need to do good works.  

    These passages demonstrate the way that we speak about good works.  We don’t speak of good works as something that we should do.  Good works are something that we want to do.  They are something that by the grace of God we can do.  And they are something that a Christian just naturally will do.  (2 Corinthians 9:8 – “…you will abound in every good work.”)

    这些经文证明了我们是如何描述好行为的。我们不说好行为是我们应该做的。好行为是我们想要做的。好行为是通过上帝的恩典我们才能做。好行为是基督徒自然而然就将会做的。（哥林多后书9:8－－“…使你们凡事常常充足，能多行各样善事。”）

    You can illustrate it this way.

    你可以用如下方式来解释。

    Think about apple trees.  Why is it that they produce apples?  Is it because they’ll feel guilty if they don’t?  Is it because they will be in some sort of trouble if they don’t produce enough fruit?  That’s foolish!  Apple trees produce apples because that’s just what apple trees do.  It’s natural.

    试想苹果树。为什么它们结果实呢？是因为如果不结果实它们觉得内疚吗？还是因为如果不结足够的果实，它们将会有些麻烦呢？真愚蠢！苹果树结苹果是因为这是它们本来就做的，这是自然的。

    Christians produce good works, not because they’ll feel guilty if they don’t, and not because they’re afraid that otherwise they’ll get in trouble with God.  Christians produce God works because Christ gave them the power to do so.  It’s what they naturally do!  Look at the following passages.

    基督徒行善，不是因为如果他们不做他们会觉得内疚，也不是因为他们害怕如果不行善，上帝将会愤怒。基督徒行善是因为基督给他们这样去做的力量。基督徒行善是自然而然的！参看下列经文。

    John 15:4-5 – [Jesus said], “Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.

    "I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.

    约翰福音15:4-5－－【耶稣说】，“你们要常在我里面，我也常在你们里面。枝子若不常在葡萄树上，自己就不能结果子；你们若不常在我里面，也是这样。“我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。常在我里面的，我也常在他里面，这人就多结果子；因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。

    Galatians 2:20 – I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God…

    加拉太书2:20－－我已经与基督同钉十字架，现在活着的不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着；并且我如今在肉身活着，是因信神的儿子而活...

8. Those passages tell us something about who can do good works.  In order to do what God considers to be “good works,” you need to be connected to Christ.  How is that connection made?  (Look at Galatians 2:20.)

    上述经文告诉我们谁能行善。为了能够做到上帝所认为的“行善”，你必须跟耶稣连在一起。这个关联是如何形成的？（参看加拉太书2:20。）

    Our connection to Jesus Christ is made through faith in Him.

9. Therefore if you didn’t have faith, would you be able to do good works in God’s eyes?

    因此，如果你没有信心，在上帝的眼里，你能够行善吗？

    No. Without faith I cannot do good works in God’s eyes.

    On the basis of the passages that we have looked at, how would you answer that question, “HOW DO WE DO GOOD WORKS?”

    基于上述我们所学经文，如何回答问题“我们如何行善？”

    We do good works as a fruit of our faith.  We do good works because God gives us both the willingness and the ability to please, honor and thank Him with our works.

    WHAT GUIDANCE DOES GOD GIVE TO HELP US LEARN WHAT HE CONSIDERS “GOOD”?

    上帝给我们什么指引来帮助我们学习什么是上帝所认为的“好”？

    Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.

    请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。

    Psalm 119:105 – Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.

    诗篇119:105－－你的话是我脚前的灯，是我路上的光。

    2 Timothy 3:16-17 – All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

    提摩太后书3:16-17－－圣经都是神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的，叫属神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。

    Romans 7:22 – In my inner being I delight in God's law.

    罗马书7:22－－因为按着我里面的意思，我是喜欢神的律。

    Psalm 119:35 – Direct me in the path of your commands, for there I find delight.

    诗篇119:35－－求你叫我遵行你的命令，因为这是我所喜乐的。

    1 John 5:3 – This is love for God: to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome.

    约翰一书5:3－－我们遵守神的诫命，这就是爱他了，并且他的诫命不是难守的。

10. According to those first two passages, where does God give us directions about how to live our lives?

    根据前两段经文，上帝给我们关于如何生活的方向在哪？

    God teaches us how to live our lives in His Word.

11. For the unbeliever, God’s laws and commands are terrifying, because they show that every person deserves punishment since no one has kept God’s commands perfectly as he requires. But according to the last three passages printed above, are God’s commands terrifying for the Christian?  Why is this the case?

    对于不信主的，上帝的律法和命令是很可怕的。它们表露了每个人都应受惩罚，因为没有一个人按照上帝要求的完美地遵守他的命令。但是，根据上述最后三段经文，上帝的命令对于基督徒来说是可怕的吗？为什么是这样呢？

    No.  For the Christian, God’s Word is a joy and delight.  Knowing that our sins against God’s laws have been forgiven by Christ, the Law no longer condemns us and is no longer our enemy.  Now we can joyfully consider the law a blessed gift from God to show us the way to live that pleases Him and fulfills the purpose for which He created and saved us.

    Matthew 22:37-39 – Jesus replied: " \`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'  This is the first and greatest commandment.  And the second is like it: \`Love your neighbor as yourself.'”

    马太福音22:37-39－－耶稣对他说：“你要尽心、尽性、尽意爱主你的神。这是诫命中的第一，且是最大的。其次也相仿，就是要爱人如己。”

    Psalm 119:104 – I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every wrong path.

    诗篇119:104－－我藉着你的训词得以明白，所以我恨一切的假道。

12. These two passages give us a brief summary of God’s commands, and therefore a summary of how we can live a life of good works.  What are the two parts of this summary?

    这两段经文对上帝的命令作了一个简短的总结，因此也是我们如何过好行为生活的总结。这个总结的两部分是什么？

    LOVE ___God___________________& ____Our  neighbor (all people)____

    HATE ___everything that is wrong_______________________

    爱 ___________________________ 和 __________________________

    恨 ________________________________________________________

    On the basis of the passages we have looked at in this portion of our Bible study, how would you answer that question, “WHAT GUIDANCE DOES GOD GIVE TO HELP US LEARN WHAT HE CONSIDERS ‘GOOD’?”

    基于上述我们所学经文，如何回答问题“上帝给我们什么指引来帮助我们学习什么是上帝所认为的‘好’？”

    God gives us the commands of His Law to teach us to know what He considers to be “good.”

    The technical term we use for the way God enables us to perform good works is “sanctify.”  He “sanctifies us.”  The word’s basic meaning is “to set apart.”

    我们所用的上帝使我们能行善的专业词汇是“成圣”。他“使我们成圣”。这个词的基本意思是“使与众不同”。

    SANCTIFY – To lead a believer to hate sin and be eager to live a life filled with good works.

    成圣－－引领基督徒憎恨罪并渴望过着充满好行为的生活。

    Therefore God is the one who justifies us.  He declares us “not guilty of sin.”  God is also the one who sanctifies us.  He “sets apart” believers as his special people who love to do his will.  Our “justification” is a completed action.  Jesus completed it on the cross.  Our “sanctification” is an ongoing action that the Holy Spirit is working inside of us.  It won’t be perfectly complete until we reach heaven.  

    因此，是上帝使我们称义的。他宣称我们“没有罪”。也是上帝使我们成圣的。他使信徒“与众不同”，愿意按照他的旨意而行事，并作为他特别的子民。我们的“称义”是一个完整的行为。我们的“成圣”则是一个正在进行的行为，圣灵在我们的内心中不停地做工。直到我们到达天堂，否则成圣是不会完美地完成的。

    Christians will slip in their sanctified lives.  Because we are still tainted with sin, we will not always see the opportunities to do good works that God places before us.  We will not always want to do them.  Look again at what the Apostle Paul himself wrote to the Romans.

    基督徒也在其成圣的生活中跌倒。因为我们仍然被罪玷污着，我们不会总是看到上帝摆在我们面前去行善的机会。我们不会总是想要行善。请参看使徒保罗在罗马书中所写的相关内容。

    Romans 7:18-19, 24-25

    I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.  For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do – this I keep on doing.

    What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?  Thanks be to God – through Jesus Christ our Lord!

    罗马书7:18-19, 24-25

    我也知道在我里头，就是我肉体之中，没有良善。因为，立志为善由得我，只是行出来由不得我。故此，我所愿意的善，我反不做；我所不愿意的恶，我倒去做。

    我真是苦啊！谁能救我脱离这取死的身体呢？感谢神，靠着我们的主耶稣基督就能脱离了。

13. Even though I don’t always do good works, I know I will live forever.  Why can I be certain that I am saved?

    尽管我不总是行善，我知道我一定会得永生。为什么我能够这么肯定我会被得救呢？

    We can be certain that we are saved because our salvation depends completely on Jesus Christ, our Savior, and not at all on our behavior.

    This concludes our study of the four key concepts – SIN, GRACE, FAITH, & WORKS.  A firm grasp on these four concepts will give you a solid foundation upon which to build with further Bible study.  May God bless your study and grant you the full assurance that you are Christ’s and that Christ is yours.

    这就结束了四个关键概念学习――罪，恩典，信心，和行为。牢固的掌握这四个概念将会给你以后的圣经学习打下坚固的基础。愿上帝祝福你的学习并赐给你坚定的信心，坚信你是耶稣的且耶稣是你的。

TAKING IT DEEPER…

深入思考…

A. Agree or Disagree – You can’t live a perfectly holy life until you become a Christian.

同意与否――在你成为基督徒以前，你不能过完美圣洁的生活。

Disagree.   Even Christians do not live perfectly holy lives until God takes away their sinfulness when they enter heaven.  Yet God considers us holy through our Substitute and Savior, Jesus, who gives us His holiness.

B. Agree or Disagree – The work of Jesus Christ gives us the chance to win eternal life by following his example.

同意与否－－通过效仿耶稣，他做工的效果给我们赢得永生的机会。

Disagree.  We have eternal life through faith in Jesus as our Savior, not by our insufficient efforts to follow His perfect example.

C. Agree or Disagree – Christians do not go to heaven because of their good works.

同意与否――基督徒上天堂不是因为他们的好行为。

Agree.   We go to heaven because of the good works of Jesus Christ.

D. Agree or Disagree – I deserve some credit for the good works I do.

同意与否――我行善，那么我应得一些赞扬。

Disagree.   Our good works done through the power of the Holy Spirit out of faith in Jesus Christ please God, but they are not meritorious.   They contribute nothing to the payment Jesus made for our salvation.

E. Agree or Disagree – Christians, who are justified, still continue to commit sins.

同意与否――称义的基督徒仍然犯罪。

Agree.  Christians still have their sinful natures which still lead them into sin.

F. Agree or Disagree – When I sin, I lose my salvation.

同意与否――我犯罪的时候，便失去了救恩。

Disagree.  Sin weakens our faith, but we still retain our faith.   If we are careless and let our faith die, we will lose our salvation, but we do not fall out of faith every time we sin.

G. Agree or Disagree – Saving faith will always produces good works.  It won’t produce them perfectly.  

同意与否――拯救的信心将会永远产生好行为。但它不会完美地产生。

Agree.   True faith produces real good works.  Yet even our best works are still tainted by by.   God considers them “good” for the sake of Jesus who has won pardon for our sins.  His pardoning love forgives the errors in our works, just as a loving parent “forgives” the mistakes in a small child’s art work that has been done to please the parent.

H. Agree or Disagree – Because we are justified by grace, through faith, God doesn’t care whether a Christian does good works or not.  He cares whether or not we have faith.

同意与否――因为我们因恩典称义，通过信心，上帝不在乎基督徒是否行善。他只在乎我们是否有信心。

Disagree.  God does care that we obey His law and live lives of love and service toward Him and others.   While our good works do not save us, they are a necessary fruit of saving faith in Jesus.

I. What do you think?  Would you agree with the following statement? “The most important thing about our lives is that we do good works.  It’s not so important why we do them.”

你如何认为？你同意下面的陈述吗？“我们生命中最重要的事情是我们去行善。至于我们为什么行善不是很重要。”

I would disagree.   The most important thing is to believe in Jesus Christ as our Savior.  After that the most important thing is to keep God’s command that we live lives of love and service toward God and people as a response to God’s saving love for us.   God does care not only about our works but the motivation behind them.  He wants them to flow from faith in Christ and love for Him.

G. What do you think?  If I am saved entirely by God’s grace and my good works have nothing to do with it, why can’t I go out and commit whatever sins I want and then ask God for forgiveness later?

你如何认为？如果我是完全被上帝的恩典所拯救的，且我的好行为在其中不起任何作用，为什么我不能犯我所想犯的罪，然后

A person who thinks this way does not understand and appreciate what it means to be saved by God from the sin that destroys us and earns us eternal death.  Thinking that it is OK to deliberately sin is an insult to the God of love and goodness and a rejection of His purpose for us that we love and do good as He does.  This attitude is a despising of God’s grace and will destroy a person’s faith and cause them to forfeit heaven and go to hell.
