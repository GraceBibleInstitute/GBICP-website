So far we’ve looked at how everyone is guilty of sin, and therefore deserving of the punishment of hell.  But we also saw how God responded to humankind’s hopelessness by graciously sending his Son Jesus to pay for sin.  But that raises the question, “If Jesus paid for everyone’s sins, isn’t everyone going to be saved?”  The answer revolves around the third key concept – faith.  In this lesson, we hope to answer the following questions:

• What is the difference between those who are saved and those who aren’t?

• What is “faith”?

• Does faith save us?

• How does someone come to faith?

目前为止，我们看到每个人都是有罪的，因此都应该受到地狱的惩罚。但是我们也看到上帝是如何回应人类的无望的，他恩慈地差他儿子耶稣来赎罪。这便提出了一个问题，“如果耶稣为每个人赎罪，是不是每个人都会得救呢？”该问题的回答围绕着第三个关键的概念――信心。在这一课，我们希望回答下列问题：

• 那些得救的和没得救的有什么区别？

• 什么是“信心”？

• 信心拯救我们吗？

• 某人是如何开始相信的？

WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THOSE WHO ARE SAVED AND THOSE WHO AREN’T?

那些得救的和没得救的有什么区别？

Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.

请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。

John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son…

约翰福音3:16－－“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们…

      根据上述经文斜体部分，圣经教导我们每个人都会得救吗？

      No, it does not say that everyone will go to heaven.

      Thus while the Bible teaches that Jesus paid for everyone’s sins, it also teaches that not everyone will be saved.  Rather, some will be punished for their sins.  Let’s look at the reason for the difference.

      圣经教导我们耶稣为每个人赎罪，也教导我们不是每个人都会得救。更确切地说，有些人将会因他们的罪而受到惩罚。让我们一起来看看产生这个区别的原因。

      John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”

      约翰福音3:16－－“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”

      马可福音16:16－－“信而受洗的，必然得救；不信的，必被定罪。”

      John 3:18 – Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.

      约翰福音3:18－－信他的人，不被定罪；不信的人，罪已经定了，因为他不信神独生子的名。

3. According to the italicized portions of those passages, whom does the Bible teach will be saved?

      根据上述经文斜体部分，圣经教导我们谁会得救？

      Romans 3:22 – This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.

      罗马书3:22－－就是神的义，因信耶稣基督加给一切相信的人，并没有分别。

      1 Peter 1:21 – Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.

      彼得一书1:21－－你们也因着他，信那叫他从死里复活、又给他荣耀的神，叫你们的信心和盼望都在于神。

5. According to those passages, what is another word for “believing”?

      根据上述经文，“相信”的另一种说法是什么？

      Another word for believing is having faith.

      On the basis of the passages we have looked at, how would you then answer the question, “WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE SAVED AND THOSE WHO AREN’T?”

      根据上述我们所学的经文，如何回答问题“那些得救的和没得救的有什么区别？”

      The difference between those who are saved and those who are not is faith in Jesus Christ.

      WHAT IS “FAITH”?

      什么是“信心”？

      James 2:19 – You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that – and shudder.

      雅各书2:19－－你信神只有一位，你信的不错；鬼魔也信，却是战惊。

      Matthew 8:28 – When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.  “What do you want with us, Son of God?” they shouted.

      马太福音8:28－－耶稣既渡到那边去，来到加大拉人的地方，就有两个被鬼附的人从坟茔里出来迎着他，极其凶猛，甚至没有人能从那条路上经过。他们喊着说：“神的儿子，我们与你有什么相干？时候还没有到，你就上这里来叫我们受苦吗？”

      The demons know that Jesus is the Son of God.  Therefore, faith is more than just simple head-knowledge about who Jesus is.

      魔鬼知道耶稣是上帝的儿子。因此信心胜过头脑里简单的知识，比如耶稣是谁。

      诗篇78:22－－因为他们不信服神，不倚赖他的救恩。

      John 14:1 – Jesus said, "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.”

      约翰福音14:1－－耶稣说：“你们心里不要忧愁；你们信神，也当信我。”

      Hebrews 11:1 – Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.

      希伯来书11:1－－信就是所望之事的实底，是未见之事的确据。

6. Faith affects more than the head.  It also affects the…?  (Look at the italicized portions of those passages.)

      信心不仅影响头脑。它也影响…？（参看上述经文斜体部分。）

7. What is another word you could use to describe this “heart-knowledge”?  (Look at the underlined portions of those verses.)

      “心灵知识”还可以用哪个词来描述？（参看上述经文划线部分。）

      Another word to describe heart-knowledge is “trust”.

8. According to Hebrews 11:1, what does faith enable people to trust in?

      根据希伯来书11:1，信心能够使人们信任什么？

      Saving faith in Jesus enables people to trust in God for the invisible, future things that God gives us by promise.

      Romans 8:38-39 – For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

      罗马书8:38-39－－因为我深信无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。

      Ephesians 2:8 – It is by grace you have been saved, through faith…

      以弗所书2:8－－你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信…

9. According to the italicized portions of these passages, what exactly is the object of our faith?  What do we put our trust in?

      基于上述我们所学经文，请回答问题“我们说‘信心’时意味着什么？”

      By faith we mean our heart’s confidence and trust in God’s love for us in Jesus Christ and what He has done to save us from our sin

      DOES FAITH SAVE US?

      信心拯救我们吗？

      Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.

      请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。

      Acts 16:30-31 – [The jailer said], “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”  They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.”

      Romans 4:3 – What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."

      罗马书4:3－－经上说什么呢？说：“亚伯拉罕信神，这就算为他的义。”

      Romans 4:23-24 – The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone,  but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness – for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.

      罗马书 4:23-24－－“算为他义”的这句话不是单为他写的，也是为我们将来得算为义之人写的，就是我们这信神使我们的主耶稣从死里复活的人。

      Philippians 3:8-9 – What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ – the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.

      腓立比书 3:8-9－－不但如此，我也将万事当作有损的，因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝。我为他已经丢弃万事，看作粪土，为要得着基督；并且得以在他里面，不是有自己因律法而得的义，乃是有信基督的义，就是因信神而来的义。

      1 John 2:1 – If anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense – Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.

      约翰一书2:1－－若有人犯罪，在父那里我们有一位中保，就是那义者耶稣基督。

11. Does the Bible teach that it is necessary for someone to have faith if they are going to be saved?  (Look especially at the first two passages.)

      圣经教导我们如果某人将会得救，信心是必要的吗？（尤其参看前两段经文。）

      Yes, the Bible teaches that it is necessary to have faith in order to be saved.

12. According to the italicized portions of those passages, what does God do for people who put their faith in Jesus as their Savior?

      根据上述经文斜体部分，上帝为那些相信耶稣为其救主的人们做些什么？

      God ends the accusations of His law against people and credits the righteousness of Jesus to them.

13. Whose righteousness do we receive as “credit” through faith?  (Look especially at the underlined portions of those verses.)

      通过信心我们得到谁的义而算为我们的义？（尤其看上述经文划线部分。）

      We receive the righteousness of Jesus Christ

      On the basis of the passages we have looked at, how would you answer the question, “DOES FAITH SAVE US?”  Or perhaps if we wanted to ask the question more specifically, “DOES FAITH IN AND OF ITSELF SAVE US, OR DOES THE OBJECT OF OUR FAITH (JESUS CHRIST AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS) SAVE US?”  (circle one below)

      基于我们所学经文，如何回答问题“信心拯救我们吗？”？或者如果我们想要回答地更具体一些，“信心它自己拯救我们吗？还是我们信心的对象（耶稣和他的义）拯救我们？”（从下面两个陈述中选一个划圈）

      WE ARE SAVED BECAUSE OF OUR FAITH.  我们得救是因为我们的信。

      WE ARE SAVED BECAUSE OF THE OBJECT OF OUR FAITH – JESUS CHRIST.  我们得救是因为我们信心的对象――耶稣基督。
      We are saved because of Jesus Christ, the object of our faith.

      The relationship between faith and salvation can be illustrated in the following way.

      信心和拯救的关系可以用下列方式来说明。

      When you received the injection of that antidote and your life was saved, you probably wouldn’t sing the praises of that wonderful hypodermic needle.  You’d sing the praises of the antidote.  The hypodermic needle had to be there, or you wouldn’t have received the antidote. But you know that the needle isn’t what saved you.  

      当你注射了那解毒剂后，你的生命就得救了。你大概不会去赞扬那个奇妙的皮下注射器针头，但是你会去赞扬解毒剂。皮下注射器针头必须存在，否则你将无法获得该解毒剂。但是你知道不是那个针头救了你。

      Likewise, faith has to be there if someone is going to be saved (cf. John 3:16 or Acts 16:30-31).  However, we know faith isn’t the cause of salvation.  Salvation is the result of the object of our faith, Jesus Christ.  Through faith we receive the benefits of his work.

      同样地，如果某人要被拯救，信心必须存在 （参看约翰福音3:16 或使徒行传16:30-31）。但是，我们知道信心不是拯救的原因。拯救是因为我们信心的对象――耶稣基督。通过信心，我们获得了他行为的益处。

      HOW DOES SOMEONE COME TO FAITH?

      某人是如何开始相信的？

      Please read the following passages and then answer the corresponding questions.

      请阅读下面的经文然后回答相关问题。

      Ephesians 2:8 – For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.

      以弗所书2:8－－你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的。

      Romans 12:3 – For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.

      罗马书12:3－－我凭着所赐我的恩对你们各人说：不要看自己过于所当看的，要照着神所分给各人信心的大小，看得合乎中道。

      John 15:16 – [Jesus said], “You did not choose me, but I chose you.”

      约翰福音15:16－－【耶稣说】，“不是你们拣选了我，是我拣选了你们。”

      1 Corinthians 12:3 – No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.

      哥林多前书12:3－－若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说“耶稣是主”的。

14. Is faith something we accomplished on our own?  Did we choose to have faith? (Look at the italicized portions of those passages.)

      信心是我们自己完成的吗？我们自己选择去相信吗？（参看上述经文斜体部分。）

      No, saving faith in Jesus is not something we create for ourselves or choose to ourselves.

15. If we didn’t choose to have faith, how did we get it?  (Look at the underlined portions of those passages.)

      如果我们没有自己选择去相信，我们是如何开始相信的？（参看上述经文划线部分。）

      We received faith as God’s free gift to us.

      Romans 10:17 – Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.

      罗马书10:17－－可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。

      2 Timothy 3:15 – From infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

      提摩太后书3:15－－并且知道你是从小明白圣经，这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣，有得救的智慧。

      2 Thessalonians 2:13-14 – But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.  He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

      贴撒罗尼迦后书2:13-14－－主所爱的弟兄们哪，我们本该常为你们感谢神；因为他从起初拣选了你们，叫你们因信真道，又被圣灵感动，成为圣洁，能以得救。神藉我们所传的福音召你们到这地步，好得着我们主耶稣基督的荣光。

16. According to the italicized portions of those verses, what does God use in order to create saving faith?

      根据上述经文斜体部分，为了创造拯救的信心，上帝使用了什么？

      God uses the Gospel in God’s Word to create saving faith in us.

      Romans 2:8 – But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.

      罗马书2:8－－惟有结党、不顺从真理、反顺从不义的，就以忿怒、恼恨报应他们。

      Ephesians 3:16-17 – I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.

      以弗所书 3:16-17－－求他按着他丰盛的荣耀，藉着他的灵，叫你们心里的力量刚强起来， 使基督因你们的信，住在你们心里。

17. While the Bible teaches that we don’t have the power to come to faith, we do have one awesome power.  According to Romans 2:8, what is that power?

      圣经教导说我们没有开始相信的力量，但是我们确实有一个令人惊叹的力量。根据罗马书2:8，那个力量是什么？

      We do have the awesome power to reject God’s Word and follow evil.

18. That’s why God’s Word is so important in our lives.  According to Ephesians 3:16-17, what does the Holy Spirit do for our faith through God’s Word?

      这就是为什么上帝的话在我们的生命中很重要。根据以弗所书3:16-17，通过上帝的话，圣灵为我们的信心做了什么？

      Through God’s Word, the Holy Spirit strengthens our faith and gives us power to remain in faith.

      On the basis of the passages we have looked at, how would you answer that question, “HOW DOES SOMEONE COME TO FAITH?”

      基于上述我们所学的经文，如何回答问题，“某人是如何开始相信的？”

      A person comes to faith by the Holy Spirit creating faith in Christ in a person’s heart through the use of the Gospel in God’s Word.

      Not only is the sacrifice Christ made for us a gift from God, our faith is also a gift from God!  Our salvation, then, is entirely God’s doing.  This raises the logical question, “What about our good works?  How do they fit in?”  That is the focus of our final key concept – WORKS.

      上帝的礼物不仅是耶稣为我们所做的牺牲，我们的信心也是上帝的礼物！我们的拯救，则是上帝作为的完全。这就提出了一个逻辑问题，“我们的好行为呢？它们如何协调的？”那便是我们最后一个关键概念的聚焦――行为。

TAKING IT DEEPER…

深入思考…

A. Agree or Disagree – Jesus paid for the sins of those people who are in hell.

      同意与否――耶稣赎了那些在地狱里的人的罪。

      Agree.  Jesus did pay for those sins of the people who go to hell and He deeply desires that they would go to heaven instead.  However, these people go to hell because they refuse to let God save them through the Gospel.

B. Agree or Disagree – The devil knows that Jesus died on the cross.

      同意与否――魔鬼知道耶稣死在十字架上。

      Agree.  The devil knows the historical facts that Jesus died.

C. Agree or Disagree – The devil has faith in Jesus’ death on the cross.

      同意与否――魔鬼相信耶稣在十字架上的死。

      Disagree.  The devil has no faith that Jesus died on the cross for him.

D. Agree or Disagree – We will go to heaven if we believe in Jesus and try to live according to our faith.  

      同意与否――如果我们相耶稣并且试着按照我们的信心去生活，那么我们将会去天堂。

      Disagree.  The reason we will go to heaven in through believing in Jesus as our Savior.   Our trying to live according to our faith is a fruit or result of having saving faith.  Neither our good works nor our faith is a meriting condition for our salvation.

E. Agree or Disagree – Faith comes to those who pray for it.

      同意与否――那些祷告的人得信心。

      Disagree.   Faith does not come through faith.  Faith comes from the Holy Spirit who creates it through our exposure to God’s Word.

F. Agree or Disagree – We have the power to keep our faith strong.

      同意与否――我们有能坚固加强我们信心的力量。

      Disagree.  We have an obligation to continue to use God’s Word so that the Holy Spirit can strengthen our faith, but it is the Holy Spirit who does the strengthening.

G. Agree or Disagree – A good pastor will bring many people to faith.

      同意与否――一位好牧师将会使很多人开始相信。

      Disagree.  It is not a human being who can create saving faith.  Only God the Holy Spirit can bring people to faith.   A Christian who faithfully shares the Gospel with people gives the Holy Spirit wonderful opportunities to bring people to faith.

H. What do you think?  A common expression is “Keep the faith!”  Another one is “You just got to have faith.”  In light of what we said saving faith is, can you explain why those expressions are completely meaningless unless further explanation is given?

      你如何认为？“保持信心”是一个很普遍的表达。另一个是“你就需要信心”。根据我们所说的拯救信心的含义，能否解释为什么这些表达是完全无意义的，除非有进一步地解释？

      By our own natural powers, we do not have the ability to come to faith or stay in faith.

I. What do you think?  You can say a Hindu, or a Muslim, or a Buddhist has faith.  You could even say that they have strong faith.  But if you say that, how are you defining faith?  Could you say those people have saving faith?

      你如何认为？你可以说一个印度教徒，一位穆斯林（伊斯兰教徒）或者一位佛教徒有信心。你甚至可以说他们有很强的信心。但是如果你这么说，你如何来定义信心呢？你可以说这些人有拯救的信心

      Faith is confidence or trust in something.   Everyone has some kind of faith.  Saving faith is trust and confidence in Jesus Christ as one’s Savior from sin.  Only Christians have Jesus Christ as the object of their faith.  Only Jesus can save.
