Ephesians 2:1-10

以弗所书 2:1-10

SIN/罪

1 As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and SINS, 2 in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. 3 All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our SINFUL nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.  

1 你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来。2 那时，你们在其中行事为人，随从今世的风俗，顺服空中掌权者的首领，就是现今在悖逆之子心中运行的邪灵。3 我们从前也都在他们中间，放纵肉体的私欲，随着肉体和心中所喜好的去行，本为可怒之子，和别人一样。

GRACE/恩典

4 But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 5 made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions – it is by GRACE you have been saved. 6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 7 in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his GRACE, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 8 For it is by GRACE you have been saved,

4 然而，神既有丰富的怜悯，因他爱我们的大爱，5 当我们死在过犯中的时候，便叫我们与基督一同活过来（你们得救是本乎恩）。6 他又叫我们与基督耶稣一同复活，一同坐在天上，7 要将他极丰富的恩典，就是他在基督耶稣里向我们所施的恩慈，显明给后来的世代看。8 你们得救是本乎恩，

FAITH/信心

…through FAITH – and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God –

…也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；

WORKS/行为

9 not by WORKS, so that no one can boast. 10 For we are God's WORKMANSHIP, created in Christ Jesus to do good WORKS, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

9 也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。10我们原是他的工作 在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们善，就是神所预备叫我们行的。
