Romans 4:16 --25

罗马书 4:16 --25

**REVIEW 回顾**

Would you say that an Old Testament person got to be innocent before God
and thus got to heaven in the same way or a different way from a New
Testament believer?

活在旧约的人需要在神面前是无罪的才能进天堂，你认为一个新约的信徒也需同样的要求才能进天堂吗？

**ROMANS 4:16-17 罗马书 4:16-17**

In last week's reading, Paul said that law, any kind of law, will bring
transgression which will result in God's anger. The law always demands,
"do" or "don't do" but we always fail to be perfect. Notice the first
word of vs 16, "therefore", Paul is now making a conclusion. The promise
of being a forgiven child of God comes by faith. It is by grace. It is a
free gift given by God. Since it is given by God, it can be guaranteed
(16). Paul makes the same point that this guaranteed promise is for Jew
and Gentile alike. Abraham is the father of us all (16). Notice an
important point -- a believer in God's promise of a Savior is a child of
Abraham, a member of his family. It doesn't make any difference if we
are Jewish, or northern European, from the far east, Africa or the
western world. Whoever has the same faith as Abraham is part of his
family and thus a part of God's family. Faith in what Jesus has done for
humanity unites us all.

在上周的阅读中，保罗说律法，无论是何种形式，都是罪过且将招致神的怒气。律法总是要求"做"或"禁止做"，但我们总是不能完全达标。注意16节的第一个词
"所以"
，保罗现在开始总结了。神所应许做被赦免的孩子是藉着信来的。这是恩典。这是神所赐的免费礼物。因为是神所赐的，所有是
"定然"
给我们的。（16节）保罗再次重述他的观点，这个定然赐下的礼物不但给犹太人也是给外邦人的。亚伯拉罕是我们所有人的父亲。（16节）。注意一个重点------一个相信神所应许的救主的信徒是亚伯拉罕的儿女，他家里的一员。不论我们是犹太人，北欧人或是远东，非洲还是西方人都没有什么不同。凡是和亚伯拉罕有着相同信心的人都是他的家人。相信耶稣为全人类所做的工将我们团聚在一起。

**DISCUSSION 讨论**

1\. Many guarantees that we experience from companies have limits and
exceptions. How is God's guarantee different?

经验告诉我们人的保证都是有限或有例外的情况，神的保证会有何不同？

2\. Is the thought that you are a child of Abraham a new thought for
you? Why is it an important point?

你是亚伯拉罕的子孙的说法对你来说是个新概念吗？为什么这是个重点？

**ROMANS 4:17b-25 罗马书4:17b-25**

God had spoken what may seem to be impossible promises. Abraham and
Sarah were going to have a child. There were two major obstacles, both
Abraham and Sarah were beyond the age of having children. From the
perspective of child-bearing, they were both as good as dead. In spite
of that, God still, "calls things that are not as though they were."(17)
The eventual child, Issac, didn't exist yet God spoke as though he did.

神所说的似乎是不可能成就的应许。亚伯拉罕和撒拉将要有个孩子。但有两大阻碍，亚伯拉罕和撒拉都过了生育的年龄。就生孩子的角度来说，他们俩都绝无可能了。尽管如此，神依然能"使无变为有"（17节）最后所生的孩子以撒还没有的时候神已经将他看为事实了。

The word translated, "he faced the fact" (19) has the idea of someone
thinking deeply about something. Abraham realized reality, he and Sarah
were well beyond the age of becoming parents. He wasn't blind to
reality. He wasn't a simpleton. He just believed God had the power and
the will to do what he said, no matter what the physical circumstances
were (21). He trusted what God promised, "This is why 'it was credited
to him as righteousness." (22) Those words were written for your
assurance as well, God does the same through faith in his promise of
forgiveness through Jesus.

"他......虽然想到"（19节）这句话在原文中意为人对某事经过仔细思考。亚伯拉罕知道现实情况，他和撒拉早超过当父母的年纪了。他不是对现实认识不清。他也不傻。他就是单单相信神有能力和意愿来成就祂所说的话，不论外在环境如何（21节）。他信靠神的应许，"所以，这就算为他的义"（22节）这些话也是为你而写的担保。神同样藉着信心由耶稣向我们应许赦免之恩。

Vs.24 Why did the Father hand over his son to death? He did it for our
sins, because of our sin. Why did the Father raise Jesus to life? He did
it for our justification. We were declared not guilty when Jesus was
still on the cross. He had paid for the sin of the world. Because we
were declared not guilty already on Good Friday, God raised Jesus to
life. He was raised to life to proclaim the victory, here was real life
evidence that sin had been paid for by Jesus. He is risen!! Alleluia!
Our forgiveness is assured -- believe it.

24节，为什么父神将祂的儿子交付死地呢？祂这样做是为了我们的罪的缘故。父神为什么使耶稣复活呢？祂这样做是为叫我们称义。当耶稣在十字架上时，我们就被宣告无罪了。祂为世人的罪付上了代价。因为我们都在那个受难日的时候被宣告无罪了，神使耶稣复活。祂复活得生命来夸胜，这就是生命中实在的证据证明藉着耶稣罪的代价已经付清了。祂已经复活了！哈利路亚！我们的救恩有着确实的把握------相信吧！
