Romans 8:18 -- 39

罗马书8:18 -- 39

Since we aren't slaves to fear in Christ (15) what kind of attitudes and
confidence can we have in Christ?

既然我们在基督里不再是奴仆不再惧怕（15）那么我们在基督里当有怎样的态度和信心？

**ROMANS 罗马书8: 18 -- 25**

We will look at several words and their meanings. Paul uses the word
translated, "consider" (18). That word has the idea of thinking about
something carefully until one reaches a conclusion. The word translated,
"comparing" (18) has the picture of an old balance scale, where weights
are put on one side to determine the weight of another object on the
other side. Once both are equal in weight it is balanced. Paul's point
is I thought about this carefully no amount of present suffering
(physical, mental, emotional) will come close to our eternal glory that
will be the believers in heaven. There is no amount of suffering in this
world that we might endure that would make our eternal inheritance no
longer worth it.

All of creation was impacted by mankind's fall into sin. As a result of
God's judgment in the Garden of Eden, all of creation was subjected to
"frustration" (20). Creation cannot accomplish its purpose for which it
was created perfectly. Paul portrays creation as waiting for Jesus
glorious return when creation also will be able to be a perfect creation
again. Like creation we also groan inwardly (23) sin, disease and
catastrophes also deeply impact us. At the same time we have a hope for
the future, we are eagerly waiting for our bodies to be glorified (23)
at Jesus return. God has already given us the Holy Spirit, which is his
guarantee (23) that he will also bring about the final step, our
physical bodies freed from sin. Since this is in the future, it is a
hope. A sure and certain hope because the God who sent his Son to redeem
us will also keep this promise. We eagerly wait with patience.

我们要查考一些字句的意思。在18节开始保罗 所用的字被翻译为 "我想"
。这个字在原文中包含对某事慎思明辨直到得出结论的意思。18节中被翻译为
"不足介意"
的这个字在原文中意指一种天平，一边放置砝码，另一边放置要称量的事物。当两边的重量相同时，就达到平衡。保罗想要说明我已经详细查考这事，没有任何现今的苦楚（身体的，精神的，情感的）可以和信徒们在将来天上所享受的永恒荣耀相比。我们在今世可能受到的任何苦难都不可能使我们在永恒中承受的产业变得不值得。

受造之物都因为人陷入罪中而受到影响。因为神在伊甸园中的审判，受造之物都"服在虚空之下"。受造之物不再能像被造之时一样完美的生活。保罗描述受造之物都在等候耶稣的荣耀再临，在那时，受造之物将再次变得完美。如同受造之物一样，我们也为内在的罪而叹息（23），罪，疾病，灾难也对我们造成了深刻的影响。同时，我们对将来存有盼望。我们切切地等候在耶稣复临之时可以身体得赎。神已经赐给我们圣灵，给我们确据，祂必然要完成祂的计划，使我们的身体从罪中被释放出来。因为这是将来的事，意味着这是我们的盼望。一个确实的盼望，因为差遣祂儿子救赎我们的神会持守祂的应许。我们忍耐着等候。

**DISCUSSION讨论**

1\. Give three examples to show that the created world has been made
"subject to frustration" because of sin.

请举出三个例子，说明受造之物因为罪的缘故而"服在虚空之下"。

2\. What future awaits the created world (vs 19-21)?

受造之物在等候怎样的未来？（19-21）？

3\. What great expectation do God's children hold on to in the midst of
their present difficulties? (vs 18,23)

神的儿女们在他们现今的苦楚中当存怎样的盼望？（18，23）

**ROMANS 罗马书8: 26 -- 30**

At times, we don't know what to pray. We don't know what the will of God
is for us. Paul assures us that the Spirit prays on our behalf. The
Spirit asks for the right solution. The Spirit and the Father have the
same agenda and so the Spirit can pray "in accordance with God's will"
(27). The "we" is clearly described in vs 17, "Now if we are children,
then we are heirs".

Paul begins vs 28 with the "we know". The basis for what we know is
explained in vs 29-30. What we know can be outlined in five points: 1)
God works -- he is ceaselessly involved with each believer. 2) for good
-- not necessarily for our earthly comfort but for our eternal salvation
-- again vs. 29-30 brings out that perspective. 3) All things -- not
occasionally or just things we pray about. 4) those who love him -- not
everyone on earth but the believers. 5) according to his purpose -- life
isn't a series of random events but God has purpose in them for our
spiritual good. How can we know these things are true? Listen to Paul's
list of five aspects of God's grace in each believer.

In verses 29-30 we are told of the eternal good God is working toward.
It started in eternity past in God's foreknowledge and predestination of
believers. It was carried out in time as those predestined were brought
to faith (called) through the Gospel proclaimed. With faith created each
believer now has received the absolute assurance of sin forgiven already
in Jesus. Each believer can anticipate a certain eternal glory. Each
step is rooted in God's grace and flows from him to us. We contribute
nothing in any of this. So we can be totally certain, even in suffering,
that God is at work for our good.

我们常常不知道要为什么祷告。我们不知道神对我们的旨意是什么。保罗使我们确信，圣灵在为我们祷告。圣灵会祈求合宜的道路。圣灵和天父同心合意，因此，圣灵可以照着神的旨意祈求（27）。这里的"我们"在17节中"（我们）既是儿女，便是后嗣"被清楚的定义了。

保罗在28节中以"我们晓得"开始。晓得的内容在29-30节中一一列举。可以将其概括为五个基本要点。1神做工
-- 祂不止息的关顾每一个信徒。2 为益处 --
不只是我们地上的好处更是为着永生的救赎 -- 29-30节再次重申这个观点。3
万事 -- 不是个别事件或只是我们放在祷告中的事。4 爱神的人 --
不是世界上的每一个人而是信徒。 5 按祂旨意 --
生活不是一系列的随机事件而是神有目的的为我们灵性的好处。我们怎么知道这是真的呢？请听保罗所列举的神为每一个信徒所赐的恩典。

在29-30节中，我们得知永生的神预先就已经做工了。祂预先就藉着自己的预知而预定拣选信徒。在历世历代中事情就按照神的预定而成就，神所拣选的就使他们藉着福音的信息得以相信（被召）。藉着所赐予的信心每一个信徒可以得着完全的在耶稣里完成的赦罪之恩。每个信徒可以预期得着永远的荣耀。所以我们可以完全的确信，即便在苦楚中，神要使我们得益处。

**DISCUSSION讨论**

**ROMANS 罗马书8: 31 -- 39**

Paul continues with a series of questions and each one has an obvious
answer. His first question isn't simply, "Who can be against us?" The
answers could be many. His question starts with a condition, If (since)
God is for us -- whoever may be against us in this world, they can't
stand up to God's love and strength. There isn't any doubt about God's
love for us. He gave his only Son, his greatest treasure for us. Since
he gave up his son for us, we can be sure he will to do anything for us.
Satan may accuse us (Rev.12:10) or our own sinful heart may condemn us
as unable to be forgiven by God, nevertheless we have been acquitted by
God because of Jesus death and resurrection. He also is at God's right
hand pleading for us on the basis of his suffering and death.

Look at what God has already done for us in Christ. His love for us is
beyond compare. God's love for us will not be overcome or diminished by
anything on earth. With God's fervent love for us we don't just survive
in difficulties we are more than conquers! God's love for us in Christ
Jesus is our strength. His steadfast and abundant love will remain no
matter what the earthly circumstances. Our confidence is rooted in
Christ and his overflowing love demonstrated for us at the cross.

保罗继续回应一系列的问题，每个问题都有清晰的答案。他的头一个问题并不简单。"谁能抵挡我们呢？"答案可能有很多。他的问题有一个前提：（因）神若帮助我们
--
在这个世界上无论谁抵挡我们，他们都不能抵挡神的爱和能力。神对我们的爱是毫无疑问的。祂赐给我们祂的独生子，祂最宝贵的赐给了我们。因为祂把祂的儿子赐给我们，我们可以确知祂愿意为我们做任何事。撒但会控告我们（启示录12:10），或是我们自己被罪所污染的心会定我们的罪，看我们不可被神赦免。然而因着耶稣的死和复活，我们已经被神无罪释放了。

查考神在基督里已经为我们所做的。祂对我们的爱无以伦比。神对我们的爱绝不能被世上任何的事胜过或消减。因着神对我们发出炽热的爱，我们不仅可以度过患难更是得胜有余了！神在基督耶稣里对我们的爱是我们的力量。无论地上的情形如何，祂坚定不移、丰丰富富的爱都不改变。我们的信心扎根在基督和祂在十字架上向我们所显明的满溢的爱。
