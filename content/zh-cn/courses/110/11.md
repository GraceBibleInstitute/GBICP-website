Romans 8:1 -- 17

How is Paul's teaching about the sinful nature and the new inner being
in the believer confirmed in your own life?

保罗关于信徒的新旧性情的教导如何在你自己的生命中得以证明？

**ROMANS 罗马书8: 1 -- 8**

Paul said in chapter 7 that living the Christian life will not be easy.
We have a sinful nature that is constantly with us and frequently
leading us into sin. It is an ongoing battle. Now, he emphasized the
Spirit and its mighty influence in the believer's life. Anyone who is in
Christ Jesus, think of it as in the sphere of Christ Jesus, there is no
condemnation. There isn't a single judgment that can be raised against a
believer. The reason, "because" (vs 2), is Jesus set me free from the
control of sin and death. Sin and its condemnation resulting in eternal
separation from God is gone. The law itself could never accomplish this.
It couldn't produce a single acquittal before God. The law was powerless
to do that, not because of a problem with the law, but the sinful nature
only rebelled against God's will. God went into action and solved the
problem.

保罗在第7章说，活出基督徒的生命并不容易。我们有着罪性常常在里面引领我们去犯罪。这是一场不断进行的争战。现在，保罗强调圣灵和祂的大能活在信徒的生命中。凡在基督耶稣里的，好像活在基督耶稣的势力范围中，就没有咒诅了。再没有任何判决可以指控一个信徒。原因在于"因为"（2节）耶稣将我从罪和死的掌控中释放出来。罪与咒诅及其与神永远隔绝的结局都被挪去了。律法自身无法成就此事。律法不能使人在神面前开罪。律法对此无能为力，这不是因为律法的问题，而是罪性只会抵挡神的旨意。神亲自采取行动来解决问题。

Here is a listing of what God did

1.  he sent his own Son, Jesus

2.  Sent him in human likeness -- had a true humanity and real flesh and
    > blood. Phil 2:7 "human likeness" however he had no sin.

3.  to be a sin offering -- he offered himself as the sacrifice for the
    > sin of the world

4.  condemned sin -- instead of sin condemning us, Sin was condemned, it
    > was paid for, it couldn't threaten us with eternal judgment
    > anymore.

5.  righteous requirements of the law -- Jesus lived a life that fully
    > and perfectly kept the law. His perfection is credited to
    > believers and is now "in us" (4).

The sinful nature of an unbeliever prompts a mindset, a way of thinking,
that only reflects who they are. There whole being and existence
conforms to the sinful nature. There whole thought process flows from
the sinful nature. The contrast is equally true for the person who
believes and thus has received the Holy Spirit. According to their new
man, in the new way of the Spirit (7:6) the believers thought process
flows from that Spirit.

Those controlled by the sinful nature are thus only hostile to God, they
can't submit to God's will and can't do anything pleasing to God. In the
next verses Paul develops the thought of the Spirit's influence on
believers.

以下是神所做的事：

1 -- 差遣祂的独生子 -- 耶稣

2 -- 使祂将世为人-- 有着完全的人性，肉体和血。 腓立比书2:7
"人的样式"只是祂没有罪。

3 -- 成为罪祭 -- 祂将自己献上为世界的罪作为祭物

4 -- 咒诅罪 --
不是罪咒诅我们而是罪被咒诅。为罪付上了代价，罪再也不能用永恒的审判威胁我们了。

5 -- 律法对义的要求--
耶稣的生命完全完美的遵行了律法的要求。祂的完全算在了信徒身上，如今归给
"我们" 了（4节）

不信的人的罪性造就某种思维方式，只会反映其本性。他们的全人及其生命都确认其罪性的存在。他们的思想都源自于罪性。与之相对的是信的人并因此而受了圣灵的人，按照他们的新人的样式，按照心灵的新样（7章6节）信徒的心思意念从圣灵而出。

那些被罪性掌控的人因为是神的仇敌。他们不能顺服神的旨意不能做任何使神喜悦的事。在下一节中，保罗进一步的分析圣灵在信徒生命中的影响。

**DISCUSSION 讨论**

1\. What Christ accomplished blessings does Paul celebrate in vs. 1-2?

2\. How did God remove the sin that the Law exposed and condemned but we
could not get rid of? (3-4)

3\. What is the spiritual condition of those controlled by the sinful
nature? (5-8)

4\. By contrast, what is the spiritual condition of those who are
controlled by the spiritual nature? (5-6)

5\. Why can't those controlled by the sinful nature please God? (8)

为什么哪些被罪性掌控的人无法取悦神？（8）

**ROMANS 罗马书8: 9 -- 17**

It is impossible to be a believer and not have the Holy Spirit. The Holy
Spirit creates faith and so whenever the Holy Spirit is in a person,
there faith has already been created by the Spirit and he is present.
Paul said the Spirit of God lives in you -- ongoing action. It isn't
that the Spirit created faith and then moves on to another person and we
are left on our own. The Spirit of God lives in every believer. Although
the Spirit lives in us, our body is still destined to die (10), but our
spiritual nature is alive. It is alive "because of righteousness." (10)
The word translated righteousness has two basic meanings, (1) being
declared not guilty before God because of Jesus, acquitted of all wrong
before God (2) doing what is right in God's eyes. Both options would fit
here, but the second fits the context better. Our spiritual nature under
the control of the Holy Spirit is guiding us to do what is right before
God. This isn't earning our forgiveness but it is the evidence that the
Holy Spirit has created faith in us. Even though our bodies are destined
to die, they will be raised to eternal life.

Through Christ and the Holy Spirit's work we are the sons of God. The
term sons of God refers to both male and females, through Christ we are
the children of God. We have been adopted into God's family and can call
the Almighty God our Father. The Holy Spirit testifies and our spiritual
nature also testifies that we are God's children and thus heirs of
eternal life. What gracious blessings the Spirit brings to us in Christ.

信徒是不可能没有圣灵同在的。圣灵建立信心，因此当圣灵在人里面的时候，信心就被建立了，同时圣灵与其同在。保罗说神的灵住在你们心里------进行时态。圣灵并不是在建立信心之后就将我们丢下去寻找下一个人。神的灵住在每一个信徒里面。尽管圣灵住在我们里面，我们的身体仍然要死（10）但我们属灵的性情是活着的。并且是"因义而活"（10）义这个字在原文中有两个基本含义，1.
在神面前因耶稣的缘故而被宣告无罪，在神面前没有过失。2.在神的眼目中做正确的事。这两者都适用于此处的翻译，但第二点更切合语境。我们属灵的性情受圣灵的掌控，指引我们做神眼中看为正的事。这并不是要我们挣得自己的赦免之恩，但是这却真实的显明了圣灵的确在我们里面建立了信心。即便我们的身体要死亡，但却要在永生中复活。

藉着基督和圣灵的工作我们成为神的儿子。"神的儿子"这个名词同时指代男人和女人，藉着基督我们成为神的儿女。我们被收养成为神家的一员，并且称呼全能神为我们的父。圣灵与我们的灵同证我们是神的儿女因此同享永生。在基督里圣灵赐给我们多么荣耀的祝福啊！

**KEYWORD 关键词-- SONS OF GOD**神的儿子- A term that includes every
believer, male or female, ethnic group or occupation in a society
(Galatians 3:26-28)

该词包含所有的信徒，无论男性、女性、民族、社会中的职业（加拉太书3:26-28)

**DISCUSSION 讨论**

Holy Spirit."

daily lives?

保罗说，"若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行"（13）这里的治死是现在时，这对我们的日常生活意味着什么？
