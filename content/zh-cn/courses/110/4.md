Romans 3:21 -- 3:31

罗马书 3:21 -- 3:31

**REVIEW 回顾**

Why do we need to continually apply the law to our own heart?

我们为什么需要不断的把律法应用在自己的内心里？

**ROMANS 3:21-24 罗马书 3:21-24**

> Paul stated the dreadful predicament every human being faces before
> God in the previous chapters. Every single person, no matter what
> race, Jew or Gentile, moral or immoral, religious or irreligious, is
> guilty and without excuse before God. Suddenly in vs 21, he begins,
> "But now." There is a righteousness (see Greek word below), a
> declaration of innocence that has its source in God. It has nothing to
> do with obedience to the law. God has revealed it. He has put it out
> into the open for all to see. The Law and the prophets (Old Testament
> writers) spoke of free forgiveness through faith not only for the Jews
> but also for the Gentiles. Twice (vs 21,22) Paul emphasized this
> righteousness comes from God. How does this righteousness come to an
> individual person? Through faith in Jesus, we simply believe what God
> has said.
>
> 保罗在前一章中澄明了每个人在神面前都处于极为不堪的窘境中。每一个人，无论民族，犹太人还是外邦人，品行端正的还是不道德的，笃信宗教的或是无信仰的，都亏欠神且无从辩解。然而从21节开始，保罗话锋一转，
> "但如今，"
> 有义显明出来（参看后文中的希腊文释义）这义就是从神来的无罪宣告。这和遵行律法无关。神已经将之显明出来，让所有人可以看见。律法和先知（旧约的作者）证明藉着信而得的白白的赦免之恩，不仅赐给犹太人也赐给了外邦人。保罗两次（21，22节）强调这义是从神来的。神的义怎么临到一个人身上呢？就是藉着在耶稣里的信心，我们仅仅信靠神所说的话语。
>
> Once again he states that there is no difference between Jew and
> Gentile -- every single human being has sinned. Those same people,
> every single human being, were declared not guilty by the payment
> Christ made for the world. God repeatedly says that the whole world
> was declared not guilty through Jesus sacrifice. God recorded the
> words of John the Baptist, "Look the Lamb of God who takes away the
> sin [of the world]{.ul}." (Jn 1:29) God's Word says, "God was
> reconciling [the world]{.ul} to himself in Christ, not counting men's
> sins against them." (II Cor. 5:19) The Bible says, "For there is one
> God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who
> gave himself as a ransom for [all men]{.ul}." (I Tim. 2:5) Of course
> we could simply recall Jesus words, "For God so loved [the world]{.ul}
> that he gave his one and only Son." (Jn 3:16) Jesus didn't give
> himself for some percentage of the world's population. He gave himself
> for the world -- yes all human beings. Every single human being has
> been declared not guilty before God through Jesus. That declaration is
> given freely. We can't in any way earn it or somehow pay for it. It is
> a gift from God.
>
> 他再次说明犹太人和外邦人没有区别------每一个人都犯了罪。同样，每一个犯了罪的人也都因基督付上的代价而被宣告无罪。上帝不断宣告世人都因耶稣的所献的祭而被宣告无罪。神这样记录施洗约翰的话，"看哪，　神的羔羊，除去[世人]{.ul}罪孽的！"（约翰福音1:29）神的话说，"这就是　神在基督里，叫[世人]{.ul}与自己和好，不将他们的过犯归到他们身上"（哥林多后书5:19)
> 圣经上说，"因为只有一位　神，在　神和人中间，只有一位中保，乃是降世为人的基督耶稣，他舍自己作万人的赎价"（提摩太前书2:5-6a)
> 我们都会记得耶稣的话，"神爱[世人]{.ul}，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不致灭亡，反得永生。"耶稣没有仅把自己给世界上一部分的人。他把自己给了世人------就是所有的人。每个人都藉着耶稣在神面前被宣告无罪。这样的宣告是白白赐下的。我们绝无可能为之付上代价。这是从神而来的礼物。

**KEYWORD: RIGHTEOUSNESS** -- Declare not guilty A word that comes from
the courtroom of the Romans. It means that a judge has declared a person
cleared of the charge that was brought against him.

**关键词**：义------被宣告无罪。这是一个罗马法庭的用词。意思是法官宣告一个人被解除了一切针对他的指控。

**DISCUSSION 讨论**

1.  How does this section of Romans and all of Scripture bring out the
    > teaching that the whole world has been declared not guilty before
    > God?

> 罗马书的这一部分和其余的经文是如何阐述所有人在神面前被宣告无罪这一教导的？

2.  2.How does God's world-wide declaration of innocence become the
    > possession of an individual person? (vs 22)

每一个人如何得着神普世的无罪宣告？（22节）

3.  Since the whole world has been declared innocent, why doesn't
    > everybody go to heaven?

如果世人都被宣告无罪了，为什么不是每个人都可以进天堂？

4.  Why can you walk up to any person anywhere and confidently say to
    > them, "Jesus has paid for your sins. You are forgiven before God"?

> 为什么你可以放胆地向任何地方的任何人宣告，"耶稣已经为你的罪付上了代价，你已经被神赦免了"？

**ROMANS 3:25-26 罗马书 3:25-26**

> Paul continues to describe how God had all people declared not guilty
> before him without compromising his holy justice to punish wrong
> doing. In vs 25 the word translated, "God presented him" has the idea
> of something or someone set out in front of people, doing a public
> display. God did something very public with his Son. He calls it "a
> sacrifice of atonement." That is an interesting word. It means "to
> satisfy someone so his anger is gone." The word is also connected to
> the Old Testament Great Day of Atonement, celebrated every year.
> Professor Panning explained one aspect of that festival in the
> People's Bible. There is another aspect to it. The high priest took
> the blood of an animal into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled it on the
> cover of the Ark of the Covenant. Atonement was made for sin. God was
> satisfied so his anger over sin was gone. Everybody knew an animal
> didn't take away sin before God but this symbolized what would take
> place when Messiah came. Jesus blood was offered in the Holy of Holies
> in heaven (Heb 9:11-14). The cover of the ark was where God's justice
> and his mercy meet. With Christ's sacrifice God's justice and mercy
> met. The sin of the world was not forgotten but was punished through
> Jesus blood. Paul emphasizes that God had left the sins of Old
> Testament people unpunished. He was patient, waiting until Jesus came.
> So God is just -- he punishes wrong doing and also the one who
> justifies. Jesus payment for the sin of the world becomes ours simply
> through faith as we believe what Jesus did.
>
> 保罗继续述说神如何是所有人在祂面前称义，同时又不违背祂圣洁的公义，就是祂一定要刑罚罪恶。在25节，圣经原文中
> "神设立耶稣"
> 这句话原文的含义中包含着把人或事物放在众人面前公开展览的意思。神和祂的儿子在进行公开的事工。神称之为
> "挽回祭" 。这是一个很有意思的词。
> 它的含义是，让某人满意以致于他不再发怒。这个词也和旧约中每年的赎罪日有关。Panning
> 教授在大众圣经读本中这个日子的部分含义。这日子还有其它意义。大祭司带着动物的血进入至圣所并弹血在施恩座上。赎罪日是为罪设立的。神达到目的因此祂因罪而起的怒气得以止息。人都知道动物的血不能除去我们在神面前的罪。但这象征着当弥赛亚来时要发生的事。耶稣的血在天上的至圣所被献上。（希伯来书9:11-14）。施恩座就是神的公义和恩典交汇的地方。藉着耶稣的献祭神的公义和恩典会合了。世人的罪不是被忘却了而是藉着耶稣的血得以刑罚。保罗强调说，神宽容旧约时人的罪。祂忍耐等候耶稣来到。因此神是公义的------祂刑罚恶行同时使人称义。耶稣为世人的罪所付上的代价赐给了我们，单单藉着信心就是信靠耶稣的话。

**KEYWORD: SACRIFICE OF ATONEMENT** -- Satisfy someone so his anger is
gone

**关键词：**挽回祭 ------ 让某人满意以致于他不再发怒。

**DISCUSSION 讨论**

5.  What comes first God's declaration of not guilty because of Jesus or
    > personal Christian faith in Jesus?

神宣告无罪和基督徒个人在耶稣里的信心，哪一样先发生？

6.  Jesus paid for the sins of everybody. That means even the people
    > that end up in hell had their sins paid for. Why did they end up
    > in hell if Jesus paid for their sins?

> 耶稣付清每个人罪的代价。这意味着即便是在地狱中的人，他们的罪也被付清了。如果耶稣已经付清了他们的罪价，为什么他们仍被下到地狱？

**ROMANS 3:27-31 罗马书 3:27-31**

> Boasting is a part of our self-centered sinful nature. Some cultures
> may express it more forcefully in words and other cultures or people
> may keep boasting confined to their thoughts. But all boasting is
> excluded in the Christian faith because we do nothing to get acquitted
> before God. Jesus did it all with his life and death for all people.
> God gives us a right standing before him simply through faith in Jesus
> blood. The word translated, "we maintain" vs. 28 has the idea of
> thinking something through very carefully and then can include what
> one realizes after thinking it through carefully. After thinking
> through carefully what God's Word says, it is obvious we are acquitted
> before God through faith in Jesus and not by anything we might do. Jew
> and Gentile alike are not guilty before God through faith in Jesus. I
> suspect you noticed in vs 30 the words, "will justify". How does that
> fit in with everything Paul has been saying? Remember the first point
> -- Jesus came to take away the sin of the world. His life and death
> for all humans produced the Father's verdict of not guilty for all
> humans. The second point made: that universal acquittal becomes the
> possession of an individual person through trust in Jesus. Faith being
> created in people will continue into the future and they will receive
> the benefit of what Christ did for them. Faith doesn't contribute
> anything to our acquittal before God. It receives that acquittal
> through believing what God has said.
>
> Paul doesn't want a wrong impression to be given. He isn't saying in
> all of this that the law is useless. It has a very important purpose.
> The law still reveals our sin and the very just anger God has with us.
> If we don't understand the anger of God over our rebellion against
> him, we can't understand it being satisfied at the cross through Jesus
> death for us. God's law and gospel are vital in the Christian faith.
>
> 夸口是我们以自我为中心的罪性。有些文化明显的表达出来，有些文化隐晦的暗藏在思想中。但在基督徒的信仰里没有任何自夸的余地，因为我们什么也没做就得到了神的赦免。耶稣为我们成就了一切，藉着祂的生命和为所有人而死。神给我们权柄站在祂面前仅仅是凭着耶稣的血而有的信心。28节中"所以我们看定了"意指经过生思熟虑后对某件事所作出的确实判断。藉着仔细思考神所说的话语，我们明显知道，人得以在神面前被赦免是藉着在耶稣里的信心而不是藉着我们所能做的任何事。犹太人和外邦人一样都是藉着在耶稣里的信心而被赦免。我想你们已经注意到30节中的"他就要因信称那受割礼的为义"（英文中为将来时态）这个词如何与保罗的论证相调和呢？请回忆第一个要点------耶稣来是为除去世人的罪。耶稣的生命和死亡是为了世界上所有的人，从而使父神裁定所有人都不被定罪。现在注意第二个要点：普世的不定罪要藉着个人信靠耶稣基督才能成就在自己身上。信心在人里面被造后会持续工作以致于使人接受基督为他们赢得的好处。信心并不对我们在神面前的无罪宣判有任何的贡献。信心藉着相信神已经说的话和接受这个无罪宣判。
>
> 保罗并不想给人一个错误的印象。他并不是说律法是无用的了。律法有着重要的目的。律法仍然显明我们的罪以及神公义的怒气。如果我们不明白神因我们的悖逆而产生的怒气，我们就不能理解神的怒气为什么能藉着耶稣在十字架上为我们而死得到平息。神的律法和福音在基督徒的信心中是至关重要的。

**DISCUSSION 讨论**

7.  Why is boasting about ourselves and how we live contrary to the
    > Christian faith?

> 为什么说自夸和靠自己的行为都是和基督徒的信心相对立的？

8.  Why are law and gospel both important to be shared with people?

为什么律法和福音都是非常重要的与人分享的信息？
