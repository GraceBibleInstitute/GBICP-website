In this lesson we will review the hard truth about ourselves:  We are sinners.  Our sinfulness is not just the evil things we do.  Our sinfulness is not just the good things we have refused to do.  Our sinfulness has to do with the fallen and ruined condition in which we were conceived and born.  In theology, we refer to this as “original sin”.  

在本课中，我们将回顾一个关于我们自己的残酷现实：我们都是罪人。 我们的罪不仅仅指我们所做的恶事，也不仅仅指我们曾拒绝去做好事。 我们的罪与我们与生俱来的堕落和败坏的状况有关。在神学里，我们称其为“原罪”。

A correct understanding of sinfulness helps us appreciate the grace of God in Christ Jesus, our Lord.  We ask God to bless our minds and hearts and to make us eager to look to our Savior with faith so that we will not die in our sin, but live with God now and forever in heaven.  Our opening Scripture:  Psalm 51:5

对罪的正确理解会帮助我们感激神在我们主耶稣基督里赐给我们的恩典。 我们求神祝福我们的思想与心灵，叫我们以相信的心渴望并转向我们的救主，使我们不致在罪中死亡，而要在天堂与神同住，从现在直到永远。 开头经文为：诗篇51：5

1] Our churches also teach that since Adam’s fall into sin, all men who are fathered in the normal physical way are conceived and born with sin. This means that they are born without the fear of God, without trust in God, and with evil desires. 2] This disease, or original sin, truly is sin. It condemns and brings eternal death to those not born again through Baptism and the Holy Spirit.

1]我们教会还教导，由于亚当的犯罪，世上所有从肉身而生的人都生来就有了罪。也就是说，他们不敬畏神、不信靠神，还带着私欲；2]这种疾病或原罪是真实的罪，对那些没有通过洗礼和圣灵得到重生的人宣判，并把他们带到永远的死亡。

3] Our churches condemn the followers of Pelagius and all others who deny that original sin is truly sin. Such people argue that humans can be justified before God by their own strength and reason. This lessens the glory of Christ’s work and its benefits.

3]我们教会定贝拉基教派信徒以及一切否认原罪是真实罪行的人为有罪；这些人争辩说，人可以靠自己的力量和智慧在神面前称义。他们的说法抹杀了基督工作的荣耀和果效。

定义

God created people in His own image.  We were created to be like God. Adam and Eve possessed “true righteousness and holiness” (Ephesians 4:24).  When God reviewed his finished work of creation (Genesis 1:31), with man and woman being the final project, he declared everything to be  _______ _________.

神按照自己的形象创造了人。 我们被创造的目的是为了像神。亚当和夏娃拥有“真正的仁义和圣洁”（以弗所书4:24）。 当神完成最后一件创作（创世记1:31）——男人和女人以后，他审视着自己所有的创作，宣告说一切都________________。

But soon, Adam and Eve sinned.  At that moment the entire human race became infected with sin. In that moment humanity died.

然而不久亚当和夏娃就犯罪了。在那一刻，整个人类都染上了罪；在那一刻，人类陷入了死亡。

Romans 5:12 “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned.”

罗马书5:12 ：“这就如罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的; 于是死就临到众人， 因为众人都犯了罪。”

Psalm 51:5 “Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.”

诗篇51：5：“我是在罪孽里生的，在我母亲怀胎的时候就有了罪。”

Who has this disease (sin) and therefore must die?

谁得了这种（罪的）疾病以致必须死亡？

Sin causes death.  Death is a broken relationship with God.  Physical death separates us from God’s physical blessings.  Spiritual death separates us from God’s spiritual blessings.

罪导致死亡。 死亡是与神断绝关系。肉体的死亡将我们与神所赐的物质上的祝福分开；灵里的死亡将我们与神属灵的祝福分开。

People have imagined all kinds of ways to restore our relationship with God.

人类设想了各种方式试图与上帝恢复关系。

Consider what King Solomon wrote in the wisdom literature of the Proverbs…

思考所罗门王在智慧之书—箴言中所写的话：

Proverbs 16:25 - There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.

《箴言》16条25节“有一条路、人以为正、至终成为死亡之路。”

Give four examples of ways that “seem right” to people.  Use the pictures for help.

举四个例子说明一个人所走的是“人以为正”的路。可以使用图画加以说明。

The apostle Paul remembered his earlier life as a Pharisee who trusted in his own goodness. Then he wrote this:

使徒保罗记得他早期作法利赛人时试图依靠个人善行来修复与神之间关系的生活。 他写到：

Philippians 3:7-9

But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 8 What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.

腓力比书3:7-9

7只是我先前以为与我有益的，我现在因基督都当作有损的。8不但如此，我也将万事当作有损的，因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝。我为他已经丢弃万事，看作粪土，为要得着基督。

9并且得以在他里面，不是有自己因律法而得的义，乃是有信基督的义，就是因信神而来的义。

What did Paul once consider as a profit in his former way of life?

保罗说在他以前的生活中，他以为有益的事情是什么？

_________________________________________________________________

Why was it impossible for Paul to find a righteousness from himself?

为什么保罗不可能从自己身上找到义？

_________________________________________________________________

How did Paul receive the holiness that God requires from him?

保罗怎样接受了神要求他必须有的圣洁？

Read:  Isaiah 64:6

阅读：以赛亚书64：6

Respond: a friend of yours says, “I’ve always tried to live a decent life and be fair to everyone and love everyone and if God can’t accept me for my efforts then I guess he will have to punish me on the Last Day.”

回应：你的一位朋友说：“我一直在努力过一个正派的生活，公正地对待每一个人，也在爱每一个人。如果神还不能因为我的付出而接纳我，那我猜他只有在审判日惩罚我了。”

回应

Ephesians 1:17 I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.  18  I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance…

以弗所书 1:17 求我们主耶稣基督的神，荣耀的父，将那赐人智慧和启示的灵赏给你们，使你们真知道他。18：并且赵明你们心中的眼睛，使你们知道他的恩召有何等指望，他在使徒中得的基业有何等丰盛的荣耀；

How should we pray for the person who thinks sinners have power to save themselves?

我们应该如何为那些认为罪人有能力拯救自己的人祷告？

</hr>

Original sin is not committed like other sins, as murder, theft, sexual immorality, slander, idolatry, and the like.  However, original sin is at work in us.  Original sin produces many kinds of sins. For Jesus once said, “Out of the heart comes…”  (See Matthew 15:19)

原罪不像其它如谋杀、盗窃、淫乱、诽谤、拜偶像等罪，但原罪却在我们里面做工，它会引发很多种罪， 因耶稣曾说，“从心里发出来的…”（见马太福音15:19）

Unfortunately, people frequently make this an excuse for their sinning.  People say “I’m just a worrisome person,” or “I’ve just been built that way” (that I lose my temper).  Or, “I can’t help looking with lust at other women, that’s just what men do.”  

 不幸的是，人们常把这一点当成自己犯罪的借口。他们说，我就是一个容易烦恼的人；或：我生来就这样（爱发脾气）。或者，我忍不住要看其她女人，那就是男人做的事。

Original sin does not excuse sinning.  Original sin is itself truly sin.  Although it is not committed like the actual sins, it yet is the source of all other sins, rendering a human being absolutely unable to please God in any way.  Ephesians 2:3 reminds us that by nature we are objects of God’s wrath.  

原罪不能宽恕罪行。原罪本身就是真实的罪。虽然它不像实际的罪行一样犯出来，它却是一切罪行的源头，使人完全没有能力以任何方式取悦神。弗2：3提醒我们，我们的本性就是神怒气的对象。

All people are born into this world with sin and without true fear and love for God.  If we do not accept this truth, then we will reject almost every other essential doctrine of Holy Scripture.

所有人都是带着罪来到这个世界，对上帝没有真正的畏惧和爱。 如果我们不接受这个事实，就会拒绝接受圣经几乎所有其它的基本教义。

When certain articles of faith challenge our intellect, our emotions and feelings [like the doctrine of original sin] we must always surrender our thinking and our feelings to the Word of God.

当某些信条挑战我们的知识、情绪和情感时（如原罪的教义），我们必须放下自己的思想和感受，而要顺服神的道。

Read:  2 Corinthians 10:5.

阅读：哥林多后书10：5。

Therefore, it is only through a radical change, a reconstruction of the heart, that we come to God, call to God, worship God, and have a living faith in God.

因此，只有借助一个根本性的改变，一次心灵的重建，我们才能到神面前来，向他呼求，敬拜他，对神产生活的信心。

God must work this change in us.

神必须在我们里面做工，使我们得到这样的改变。

Ezekiel 36:24-29a

For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.  I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.  I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.  And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.  You will live in the land I gave your forefathers; you will be my people, and I will be your God.  I will save you from all your uncleanness…”

以西结书36：24-29上

24 我必从各国收取你们，从列邦聚集你们，引导你们归回本地。25 我必用清水洒在你们身上，你们就洁净了。我要洁净你们，使你们脱离一切的污秽，弃掉一切的偶像。26 我也要赐给你们一个新心，将新灵放在你们里面，又从你们的肉体中除掉石心，赐给你们肉心。27 我必将我的灵放在你们里面，使你们顺从我的律例，谨守遵行我的典条。28 你们必住在我所赐给你们列祖之地。你们要作我的子民，我要作你们的上帝。29 我必救你们脱离一切的污秽，

This radical change can only take place by God Almighty and the saving arm of his Son, Jesus Christ, working together with the Holy Spirit who calls us to faith in his completed work of redemption.  

   这一根本的改变只能由全能的神和他儿子耶稣基督拯救的膀臂，与圣灵一同工作，在救赎的工作中呼吁我们来相信，才能发生。

Review of Article 2 – About Original Sin

回顾信条2——论原罪

Prepare your answers so we can review Article 2 at the start of our next session.

请预备好你的答案，使我们在下节课开始时能够复习信条2的内容。

1. True or False:  Jesus was born of a woman.  Therefore Jesus was born with original sin.  [See Luke 1:35; John 1:13; John 8:46.  [Explain your answer.]

    判断对错：耶稣是由女人所生，所以耶稣出生时有原罪。 [见路加福音1:35; 约翰福音1:13; 约翰福音8:46。] [解释你的答案。]

2. True or False:  People do not choose to be conceived and born in sin.  Therefore God does not consider people guilty just because people have original sin.

    判断对错：一生下来就有罪不是人类自己选择的， 所以上帝不会因为人有原罪就定人有罪。

Ephesians 2:8-10 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.  For we are God’s workmanship, crated in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

以弗所书2:8-10：你们得救是本乎恩，也因著信。这并不是出于自己，乃是 神所赐的； 也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。 我们原是他的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是神所预备叫我们行的。”

Let’s break this very important passage of Scripture down:

我们把这节非常重要的经文分开：

1. Grace has _____________ you.  And grace is not ____________________.  

2. The instrument through which we receive God’s grace is _____________.

3. Faith is being __________of what we hope for and______________ of what we do not__________.  (Hebrews 11:1)

4. Grace is a gift from God to us. Therefore we can all be certain that our ___________ had nothing to do with saving us.  

5. In our sinful condition, salvation was impossible for us to accomplish because of our _____________.  

6. After God has emptied us of all pride and self-righteousness, he created a living ______________ in our hearts that now ______________ to his grace.  

7. For we are God’s workmanship only in light of the ____________ he created in our hearts.  

8. For without ___________ it is impossible to please God.  (Hebrews 11:6)

9. Through faith and the continuing power of the gospel, God has designed us to do ________________.  

10. Good works are anything that is done out of __________ for God and according to God’s will.

-

1. 恩典已经____了你，而且这恩不是______。

2. 使徒保罗把神用以传递他恩典的途径称为________。

3. 信是_______我们所盼望的事情，而且________我们还没有_______的事情。(Hebrews 11:1)

4. 因为恩典是神的礼物，所以我们都可以确定我们的_______和我们无关。

5. 在我们罪恶的本性里，救恩不可能靠我们来完成，因为我们是________。

6. 神倒空了我们所有的骄傲和自以为义之后，在我们的心里造了一个活泼的_________, 现在可以______他的恩典，

7. 因为只有借助他在我们里面所造的______，我们才可以成为神的工作,

8. 因为没有_______就不能得神的喜悦。(Hebrews 11:6)

9. 透过信心和福音不间断的大能，神已经把预定我们去行_____。

10. 善行是从________发出的任何事情。

Explain this paradox

解释这一矛盾

Dr. Martin Luther (1483-1546) rejected the idea that sinful human reason is able to figure out how sinners are to be saved.  Luther called reason “the devil’s damned whore”. Luther’s small catechism states “I cannot by my own thinking … believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to him.”

有人认为人类有罪的理性能够找到让罪人得救的办法，但马丁·路德博士（1483-1546）反对这种观点。路德称理性为“魔鬼被咒诅的妓女”。 路德在《小要理问答》中写道：“我不能凭我自己的想法---去相信耶稣基督我的主，或者来到他面前。”

At the same time, Luther called reason God’s greatest and most important gift to people.  Luther called reason a gift of inestimable beauty and excellence, a glorious light, a most useful servant by which we learn God’s Word.

同时，路德也称理性是上帝赐予人类最好、最重要的礼物，这件礼物有着无价之美和优点，有着荣耀的光芒，是我们可以用来学习神话语的最有用的仆人。

Augsburg Confession

奥格斯堡宣言

Article 3: About the Son of God[1]

信条3：论耶稣基督

1] Our churches also teach that the Word, that is, the Son of God, took upon himself human nature in the womb of the blessed virgin Mary. 2] Therefore, he has two natures, one divine and the other human. They are united in one person and cannot be separated. Thus there is only one Christ, true God and true man, who was born of the virgin Mary. He truly suffered, was crucified, died, and was buried. 3] He went through all this so that he could restore us to peace with the Father and be a sacrifice, not just for original sin, but also for all other sins.

我们教会还教导，道(话语），即神的儿子，取了人的样式，由蒙恩的童贞女玛利亚所生。所以，他具有两个性情，他既是人又是神，神、人二性不可分割地共存于一人之内。2]因此，只有一位基督，他是真神也是真人。由童女玛利亚所生，真实地遭遇苦难，被钉在十字架上，死了，埋葬了。3]他承受这一切都是为了让我们能与父神恢复和平；他作了我们的赎罪祭，不仅为我们的原罪（从亚当继承来的罪性），也为我们所犯的所有其它罪行。

4] The Word [Christ] also went down into hell, and truly rose again the third day. Afterward he went up into heaven so that he might sit on the right hand of the Father. There he rules forever and has power over all creatures, making holy all those that believe in him. 5] He does this by sending the Holy Spirit into their hearts to rule, comfort, and make them alive, as well as defending them against the devil and the power of sin.

4]道[基督]也曾降到阴间，又真实地在第三天复活；后又升到天上，坐在天父的右边，永远掌权，统管万有。5]他差遣圣灵进入人心做工，管理、安慰他们，使他们活过来，并保守他们抵挡仇敌和罪的权势，通过这种方式使一切相信他的人成为圣洁。

6] This same Christ will openly come again to judge the living and the dead, etc., as the Apostles’ Creed says.

6]如使徒信经所说，这同一位基督还将再次公开到来，审判活人和死人，---等等。
