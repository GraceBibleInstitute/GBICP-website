基督教教义学习简介

第一章——基督教教义学习

ALS双语PDF文件：第一章 第30-48页 [NPH: 第22-34页]

Introduction 简介

In lesson 2 we saw that some Christian churches do not base their teachings on the Bible alone.  Some of these churches elevate reason above the Bible.  Others accept traditions as authoritative. 
在第二课中，我们看到基督教教会教导的根基并不是仅仅有圣经。
Traditions change.  Human thinking changes.  In this lesson we want to see that the Bible is unchanging and therefore our faith does not change.
传统会改变。人们的想法会改变。本课我们将会看到，圣经是不变的。因此，我们的信心也不会更改。

Hebrews 13:7-8 Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.

Jesus does not change.  His Word also will not change. 
耶稣不会改变。他的话也不会改变。

A.	Christianity is the absolute religion
基督教是绝对宗教	
1.	Christianity gives us the only way to heaven
基督教给我们唯一去往天堂的道路
a.	All man-made religions are based on works.
所有人创宗教都是基于行为
Romans 1:20-21; 25  For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.  For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. …They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.  
罗1:20-21；25 自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但借着所造之物，就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。因为他们虽然知道神，却不当作神荣耀他，也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄，无知的心就昏暗了。……他们将神的真实变为虚谎，去敬拜事奉受造之物，不敬奉那造物的主。主乃是可称颂的，直到永远。阿们。


b.	Only Christianity teaches salvation by grace.
唯有基督教教导因恩典得救恩

Romans 1:16-17 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.  For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.” 
罗1:16-17 我不以福音为耻。这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的，先是犹太人，后是希利尼人。因为神的义，正在这福音上显明出来。这义是本于信以致于信。如经上所记，义人必因信得生。

2.	Christianity is based on the inspired, errorless, unchanging Word of God
基督教建基于神所启示、无误且不变的神的话

a.	The Word of God (The Bible) does not change.
神的话（圣经）不会改变

Isaiah 40:8 The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.”
【赛40:8】 草必枯干，花必凋残，惟有我们神的话，必永远立定。

Matthew 5:18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
【太5:18】 我实在告诉你们，就是到天地都废去了，律法的一点一画也不能废去，都要成全。

b.	 The Bible’s message applies to all people at all times.
 圣经信息适用于所有世代所有人

Matthew 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
【太28:19】 所以你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗。

Acts 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
【徒1:8】 但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力。并要在耶路撒冷，犹太全地，和撒玛利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。

B.	Theology is an active aptitude to administer the treasures of Scripture
神学是掌握圣经宝贵财富的一项积极能力

a.	Those who serve in the public ministry of the church must have this aptitude (ability).
所有在教会公共服事上有份的人都应该有这种能力

1 Timothy 3:2  Now the overseer is to be…able to teach….
【提前3:2】 作监督的，必须……善于教导……

b.	 Only the Holy Spirit can give this ability to us.
只有圣灵能够赐给我们这项能力

1 Corinthians 2:14  The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 
【林前2:14】 然而属血气的人不领会神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙。并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。

Acts 26:17-18 I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’ 
【徒26:17-18】 我也要救你脱离百姓和外邦人的手。我差你到他们那里去，要叫他们的眼睛得开，从黑暗中归向光明，从撒但权下归向神。又因信我，得蒙赦罪，和一切成圣的人同得基业。

C.	Christian doctrine is everything that the Bible teaches
一切基督教教义都是圣经的教导

a.	Only the Bible determines Christian doctrine.
唯有圣经可以决定基督教教义

i.	 Reason does not determine what is true.
理性不能决定什么是真理

1 Corinthians 2:9-10a However, as it is written: “What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived”— the things God has prepared for those who love him— these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.
【林前2:9-10上】 如经上所记，神为爱他的人所预备的，是眼睛未曾看见，耳朵未曾听见，人心也未曾想到的。只有神借着圣灵向我们显明了。


ii.	 We must teach the truth clearly.
我们教导真理必须清楚明了

2 Timothy 1:13-14  What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
提后1:13-14 你从我听的那纯正话语的规模，要用在基督耶稣里的信心和爱心，常常守着。从前所交托你的善道，你要靠着那住在我们里面的圣灵，牢牢的守着。

b.	 All the Bible is valuable for Christian teaching.
圣经全部都对基督教教导有益

i.	Every word is there for a reason.
每个字的存在都有目的

John 10:34-35 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods”’? If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside— 
约10:34-35 耶稣说，你们的律法上岂不是写着，我曾说你们是神吗？经上的话是不能废的。

Galatians 3:16 The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ. 
【加3:16】 所应许的原是向亚伯拉罕和他子孙说的。神并不是说众子孙，指着许多人，乃是说你那一个子孙，指着一个人，就是基督。

ii.	The Bible teaches a unified message.  Jesus is the center of its message. 
圣经教导一个独特的信息。耶稣就是这个信息的中心。


Romans 16:17  I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. 
【罗16:17】 弟兄们，那些离间你们，叫你们跌倒，背乎所学之道的人，我劝你们要留意躲避他们。

c.	 Individual doctrines of the Bible can be distinguished from each other.
圣经的教义彼此之间可以区别开来

  
Matthew 22:29-30 Jesus replied, “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. 
太22:29-30 耶稣回答说，你们错了。因为不明白圣经，也不晓得神的大能。当复活的时候，人也不娶也不嫁，乃像天上的使者一样。
D.	The Bible distinguishes between teachings basic to salvation and teachings that assist faith
圣经中有关救恩根基的教导和辅助信仰的教导是有区别的

1.	Fundamental doctrines are so basic that we cannot be saved if we deny them.
基要教义乃是根基，否认它们就无法得救

a.	The doctrine of justification
称义的教义

Galatians 5:4 You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. 
【加5:4】 你们这要靠律法称义的，是与基督隔绝，从恩典中坠落了。

b.	The doctrine of the Triune God
三位一体之神的教义

Isaiah 42:8  “I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.
【赛42:8】 我是耶和华，这是我的名。我必不将我的荣耀归给假神，也不将我的称赞归给雕刻的偶像。

Isaiah 48:16  “Come near me and listen to this: “From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret; at the time it happens, I am there. And now the Sovereign LORD has sent me, endowed with his Spirit.
【赛48:16】 你们要就近我来听这话。我从起头并未曾在隐密处说话，自从有这事，我就在那里。现在主耶和华差遣我和他的灵来。
John 5:23 …that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.
【约5:23】 叫人都尊敬子，如同尊敬父一样。不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差子来的父。
c.	The doctrine of sin and repentance
罪和悔改的教义

Acts 2:38   Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
【徒2:38】 彼得说，你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵。

d.	The doctrine of the forgiveness of sins
罪得赦免的教义

Psalm 130:3-4  If you, LORD, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.
【诗130:3-4】 主耶和华阿，你若究察罪孽，谁能站得住呢？但在你有赦免之恩，要叫人敬畏你。

e.	The doctrine of the person of Jesus Christ
耶稣基督生平的教义

Colossians 2:8-10a See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ. For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness.
【西2:8-10上】  你们要谨慎，恐怕有人用他的理学，和虚空的妄言，不照着基督，乃照人间的遗传，和世上的小学，就把你们掳去。因为神本性一切的丰盛，都有形有体的居住在基督里面。你们在他里面也得了丰盛。
f.	The doctrine of the vicarious atonement
代赎的教义

2 Corinthians 5:14-15 For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
【林后5:14-15】 原来基督的爱激励我们。因我们想一人既替众人死，众人就都死了。并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人，不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。

g.	The doctrine of the physical resurrection of Jesus from the dead
耶稣身体从死里复活的教义

1 Corinthians 15:12-14 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 
林前15:12-14 既传基督是从死里复活了，怎么在你们中间，有人说没有死人复活的事呢？若没有死人复活的事，基督也就没有复活了。若基督没有复活，我们所传的便是枉然，你们所信的也是枉然。

h.	The doctrine of the gospel
福音的教义

John 14:6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 
【约14:6】 耶稣说，我就是道路，真理，生命。若不借着我。没有人能到父那里去。



Acts 4:12  Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”
【徒4:12】 除他以外，别无拯救。因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠着得救。

2.	Non-fundamental doctrines strengthen or assist our faith but are not essential to salvation.
非基要教义增强或者辅助我们的信心，但是对救恩而言并非主要

a.	The doctrine of angels
天使的教义

Matthew 18:10 “See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
【太18:10】 你们要小心，不可轻看这小子里的一个。我告诉你们，他们的使者在天上，常见我天父的面。

b.	The doctrine of verbal inspiration
言语默示的教义

2 Timothy 3:15-17  …and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
【提后3:15-17】 并且知道你是从小明白圣经。这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣有得救的智慧。圣经都是神所默示的，于教训，督责，使人归正，教导人学义，都是有益的。叫属神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。

3.	Secondary fundamental doctrines
次要的基要教义

a.	Baptism
洗礼

John 3:5  Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 
【约3:5】 耶稣说，我实实在在地告诉你，人若不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进神的国。

b.	The Lord’s Supper
主的晚餐

1 Corinthians 10:21-22  You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons. Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
【林前10:21-22】 你们不能喝主的杯，又喝鬼的杯。不能吃主的筵席，又吃鬼的筵席。我们可惹主的愤恨吗？我们比他还有能力吗？

4.	Open questions
开放问题

a.	On what day were the angels created?
天使是在哪一天被造？

Job 38:4-7 
“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
    Tell me, if you understand.
Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!
    Who stretched a measuring line across it?
On what were its footings set,
    or who laid its cornerstone—
while the morning stars sang together
    and all the angels (literally: sons of God) shouted for joy?
伯38:4-7 
我立大地根基的时候，你在哪里呢？
你若有聪明，只管说吧。
你若晓得就说，是谁定地的尺度？
是谁把准绳拉在其上？
地的根基安置在何处？
地的角石是谁安放的？
那时晨星一同歌唱，
神的众子（译者注：该部分英文版翻译为“众天使”，小注为“神的众子”）也都欢呼。

b.	Will the world be annihilated or renewed on the Last Day?
在末日那天，世界是会被毁灭还是更新？

Matthew 19:28  Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
【太19:28】 耶稣说，我实在告诉你们，你们这跟从我的人，到复兴的时候，人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上，你们也要坐在十二个宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。

2 Peter 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.
【彼后3:10】 但主的日子要像贼来到一样。那日天必大有响声废去，有形质的都要被烈火销化。地和其上的物都要烧尽了。

E.	The academic divisions of theology
神学上的学术分歧

F.	We grow in the study of Christian doctrine through prayer, meditation, and trial
我们对基督教教义的学习在祷告、默想和试炼中成长

a.	Prayer祷告

Psalm 119:18 Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.
【诗119:18】 求你开我的眼睛，使我看出你律法中的奇妙。

b.	Meditation默想

Psalm 1:1-2 
Blessed is the one
    who does not walk in step with the wicked
or stand in the way that sinners take
    or sit in the company of mockers,
but whose delight is in the law of the LORD,
    and who meditates on his law day and night.
诗1:1-2 
不从恶人的计谋，
不站罪人的道路，
不坐亵慢人的座位。
 惟喜爱耶和华的律法，
昼夜思想，这人便为有福。

c.	Trial试炼

Daniel 9:1-6  In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes (a Mede by descent), who was made ruler over the Babylonian kingdom— in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the LORD given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years. So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.  I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed “Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.
但9:1-6 玛代族亚哈随鲁的儿子大利乌立为迦勒底国的王元年，就是他在位第一年，我但以理从书上得知耶和华的话临到先知耶利米，论耶路撒冷荒凉的年数，七十年为满。我便禁食，披麻蒙灰，定意向主神祈祷恳求。我向耶和华我的神祈祷，认罪，说，主阿，大而可畏的神，向爱主，守主诫命的人守约施慈爱。我们犯罪作孽，行恶叛逆，偏离你的诫命典章，没有听从你仆人众先知奉你名向我们君王，首领，列祖，和国中一切百姓所说的话。
Conclusion
结语
God’s Word, the Bible, is able to give us a correct and complete understanding of who God is and how he saves us through Jesus Christ, his one and only Son.  The Holy Spirit works through his Word to give us the ability to teach his Word correctly.
圣经是神的话，能够让我们正确并且完备地明白神是谁，并且明白他是如何借着他的独一爱子耶稣来拯救我们。圣灵借着他的话帮助我们，去准确地教导别人他的话。
