Introduction 引言:

In this lesson we will explore some of the primary sections of the Bible that address the topic of marriage. These precious passages from God’s Word will give us a better understanding of God’s plan to bless people in marriage.

在本课我们将探讨圣经中有关婚姻的一些主要章节。来自神宝贵的话语将使我们更好地明白神的计划和对人婚姻的祝福。

## A. Ephesians 5:22-33

{{< bible "Ephesians 5:22–33" "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church—for we are members of his body. “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband." "NIV" >}}

{{< bible "以弗所书 5：22–33" "你们作妻子的，当顺服自己的丈夫，如同顺服主。因为丈夫是妻子的头，如同基督是教会的头；他又是教会全体的救主。教会怎样顺服基督，妻子也要怎样凡事顺服丈夫。你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。要用水借着道把教会洗净，成为圣洁，可以献给自己，作个荣耀的教会，毫无玷污、皱纹等类的病，乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。丈夫也当照样爱妻子，如同爱自己的身子；爱妻子便是爱自己了。从来没有人恨恶自己的身子，总是保养顾惜，正像基督待教会一样，因我们是他身上的肢体。为这个缘故，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。这是极大的奥秘，但我是指着基督和教会说的。然而，你们各人都当爱妻子，如同爱自己一样。妻子也当敬重她的丈夫。" "CUV" >}}

1. Of what great spiritual relationship does God intend the marriage of a man and a woman to be a reflection? ( see verses 23-27, 32)

    神想要男人和女人的婚姻反映了什么伟大的属灵关系? (参看 23- 27,32 节)

2. When God addresses the wife’s role in marriage in verses 22-24, He calls on the wife to submit to her husband. The word “submit” in this context is often misunderstood to mean “to give the slavish, unquestioning obedience of an inferior person to one who is superior.” Actually, the word “submit” as used here means “to willingly surrender one’s self-interests and accept the responsibility to live for the benefit of the one God has placed in authority over you.”

    当神在 22-24 节谈到妻子在婚姻中的角色时，他呼吁妻子顺服她的丈夫。“服从”这个词在文中经常被误解为“上级对下级盲从和绝对的服从”。事实上，“顺服”用在这的意思是“甘愿放弃自己的利益去承担责任，就为那赐给你力量的神而活”。

3. In what ways is the Church’s (all Christian believers’) submission to Jesus Christ a model for a wife to follow as she relates to her husband? (see verses 22-24)

    教会(所有基督徒)以何种方式顺服耶稣基督，成为妻子遵循她与丈夫关系的榜样? (见第 22 - 24 节)

4. What great responsibility does God give the husband in his relationship to his wife in verses 25-27?

    在 25-27 节中，在丈夫与妻子的关系中神赋予了丈夫什么重大的责任？

5. In what ways is Christ’s love for the Church (all Christian believers) a model for the husband to follow as he relates to his wife? (verses 25-27)

    基督对教会(所有基督教信徒)的爱在哪方面是丈夫在与妻子相处时应该遵循的榜样? (第 25 - 27 节)

6. What additional point is God making in verses 28-31 when He calls on husbands to love their wives as they love themselves?

    在 28-31 节中神呼吁丈夫爱妻子就像爱他们自己一样，这额外说明了什么?

7. What important understanding about what happens in marriage does God give when Paul quotes Genesis 2:24 in verse 31?

    保罗在 31 节引用创世记 2:24，神对婚姻中发生的事给了什么重要的领悟？

8. What do phrases such as “Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior,” (verses 23b) and “just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless,” (verses 25b-27) teach us about what motivates Christians to fulfill the roles God gives them in marriage?

    诸如“基督是教会的头；他又是教会全体的救主。”(23 节下),“正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。 要用水藉着道把教会洗净，成为圣洁， 可以献给自己， 作个荣耀的教会， 毫无玷污、皱纹等类的病， 乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。”(25 节下-27 节) 这些话语教导我们什么去激励基督徒履行神给他们在婚姻中的角色？

## B. 1 Peter 3:1-7

{{< bible "1 Peter 3:1–7" "Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight. For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear. Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers." "NIV" >}}

{{< bible "彼得前书 3：1–7" "你们作妻子的要顺服自己的丈夫；这样，若有不信从道理的丈夫，他们虽然不听道，也可以因妻子的品行被感化过来；这正是因看见你们有贞洁的品行和敬畏的心。你们不要以外面的辫头发，戴金饰，穿美衣为妆饰，只要以里面存着长久温柔、安静的心为妆饰；这在　神面前是极宝贵的。因为古时仰赖　神的圣洁妇人正是以此为妆饰，顺服自己的丈夫，就如撒拉听从亚伯拉罕，称他为主。你们若行善，不因恐吓而害怕，便是撒拉的女儿了。 你们作丈夫的也要按情理和妻子同住；因她比你软弱，与你一同承受生命之恩的，所以要敬重她。这样，便叫你们的祷告没有阻碍。" "CUV" >}}

1. Similar to what God teaches in Ephesians 5, what does God expect of wives in relation to their husbands? (verse 1)

    类似于神在以弗所书 5 章所教导的，神期望妻子与丈夫有什么关系? (1 节)

2. What does God state as the primary way for Christian wives to influence their non-Christian husbands to embrace the Christian faith? (verses 1-2)

    神教导基督徒妻子影响非基督徒丈夫接受基督教信仰的主要方式是什么? (1 - 2 节)

3. In light of what God teaches in verses 1-2, comment on the quotation: “Love that is only talked about is easily turned aside, but love that is demonstrated is almost irresistible.”

    根据神在 1-2 节中的教导，评价这句话:“挂在嘴边上的爱情很容易放到一边；表现在行动上的爱情则不可抗拒。”

4. What does God teach us about the essence of true beauty in a woman in verses 3-5a?

    在 3-5 节中上帝教导我们关于女人真正美丽的实质是什么？

5. Identify two ways in which the beauty that comes from outward adornment and the beauty of a godly, inner self are different.

    辨别两种方式的不同，来自外在修饰的美和来自自我敬虔内在的美。

6. What are some things that might cause a Christian wife to give way to fear and so fail to do what is right in her marriage and in her life before God? (verse 6)

    在神面前，什么事情会使一个基督徒妻子她的婚姻和生活中屈于惧怕而不能做对的事情? (6 节)

    在婚姻关系中，丈夫尊重妻子“因她比你软弱”这意味着什么? (7 节)
