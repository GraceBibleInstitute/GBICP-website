He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” On hearing this, they were baptized (ἐβαπτίσθησαν) into the name of the Lord Jesus.”

## HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT 家庭作业

Read the following statements about the meaning of the word “baptism”. Then give your own opinion about the statement. Do you agree or disagree with it? Is it good or bad? What do you like (or don’t like) about it? Be ready to share your answers at the beginning of the next class.

阅读下列关于“洗”这个字意思的陈述。然后给出你对于这些陈述的看法。你是否同意？该陈述是好的还是不好？对于陈述，你喜欢（或不喜欢）哪一点？请准备在下次上课开始的时候分享。

### Statement 1 陈述一

“Linguistically, the Greek word baptízō need not imply baptism by immersion; at Luke 11:38 Jesus “did … wash (Greek ebaptísthē, literally “was washed”) before dinner.”

“从语言学上来说，希腊文词语baptízō不仅仅是指浸礼；在路11:38当中，耶稣‘……洗（希腊文ebaptísthē，直译就是‘被洗饭前’）’”。

Myers, A. C. (1987). In The Eerdmans Bible dictionary (p. 123). Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans.

### Statement 2 陈述2

“Baptism refers to the act of washing associated with ritual and spiritual purification.”

“洗礼是指与仪式洁净和属灵洁净相关的洗。”

Snyder, B. J. (2014). Baptism. D. Mangum, D. R. Brown, R. Klippenstein, & R. Hurst (Eds.), Lexham Theological Wordbook. Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

### Statement 3 陈述3

“In fact, the terms bapto and baptizo, the verb, and baptismas, the noun, could have been translated “immerse” and probably would have solved a lot of problems, but the translators chose to transliterate the Greek baptizo into “baptise.” They transliterated it rather than translate it because it had become such a technical term for “immersion.” So, they just transliterated it across, but that doesn’t change the meaning—it means “to immerse.”

“实际上，动词bapto、baptizo, 和名词baptismas完全可以被翻译为‘浸入’，那样就能解决很多问题。但是翻译者却选择音译，把希腊文baptizo翻译为‘baptize’。”他们选择音译而不是直接翻译，是因为其是“浸入”的一个技术性词语。所以，他们只是音译，但是那无法改变其含义——它的意思就是“浸入”。

John Macarthur: A Scriptural Critique of Infant Baptism

Read 1 Peter 3:20-21. 阅读彼前3:20-21。

Notice how in the original language of this verse Noah and his family and the world were not saved FROM water, but BY water. In other words, this verse is saying that it was the water that saved them, and not the ark. How was it that the water saved them?

请注意本节原文，诺亚和他的家人和世界不是从水里得救，而是因水得救。也就是说，这节经文说他们是因为水而得救，不是方舟。为什么是水救了他们？
