### A.    God's Teachings Of Law And Gospel Work Together To Sanctify Believers in Jesus Christ 神律法与福音的教导共同作用，使基督徒靠着主耶稣而圣洁

1.    God uses His two great truths of law and gospel to work in harmony to accomplish the vital work of enabling believers in Jesus Christ to live the new spiritual life the Holy Spirit creates in them.

    神的律法与福音两大真理和谐运作一同完成伟业——使基督徒能够在主耶稣里活出圣灵已建构于他们内心的全新的属灵生命。

2.    In this new life, the Holy Spirit sanctifies people.  When He sanctifies, the Holy Spirit sets people apart further from sin and brings them nearer to God and His holy purposes.

    在这个新生命中，圣灵使人圣洁，使人远离罪恶，使人更加靠近神及他神圣的目的。

3.    Both the law and gospel play very different, but very important roles in accomplishing the sanctification of Christians.

    在使基督徒圣洁的过程中，律法与福音具有同等重要的地位、各不相同的角色。

4.    God's Holy Spirit works through the law to lead Christians to be aware of the dangers of sin, to continue to be genuinely sorry for their sins and to know the good things that God wants them to be and to do.

    神的圣灵通过律法带领基督徒意识并警惕罪恶之凶险，继续真诚悔过，明白什么是神要他们去做的美善事工。

5.    God's Holy Spirit works through the gospel to lead Christians to be strong to fight against the power of sin, to be confident that God continues to forgive them for their sins and to have the proper spiritual desire and strength to  produce God-pleasing good works.

    神的圣灵通过福音带领基督徒勇敢无畏地与罪恶权势抗争，使他们对神的宽恕充满信心，具有属灵的力量与渴望去做蒙神喜悦的事。

### B.    The Law And Gospel Work To Assist Christians To  Fight Against The Power Of Sin In Their Lives 律法与福音辅助基督徒与他们生命中的罪恶权势抗争

God uses His teachings of law and gospel to help believers in Christ to make progress in their fight against the efforts of their sinful nature and other spiritual enemies to lead them to sin against God.

神以律法与福音的教导帮助信靠耶稣基督的人在与自己的罪性及任何引诱他们背离神的一切属灵之敌的抗争中不断进取得胜。

1.    God uses the alarming message of the law to warn believers against giving in to temptations to sin.

    神以律法警示基督徒，不要被罪恶引诱。

    The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery, idolatry and witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissentions, factions and envy, drunkenness, orgies and the like.  I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.  （Galatians 5:19-21）

    情欲的事都是显而易见的；就如奸淫、污秽、邪荡、拜偶像、邪术、仇恨、争竞、忌恨、恼怒、结党、纷争、异端、嫉妒（有古卷在此有“凶杀”二字）、醉酒、荒宴等类，我从前告诉你们，现在又告诉你们，行这样事的人，必不能承受　神的国。（加拉太书5:19-21）

    Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.  Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness.  （Romans 6:12-13a）

    所以不要容罪在你们必死的身上作王，使你们顺从身子的私欲。也不要将你们的肢体献给罪作不义的器具。（罗马书6:12-13a）

2.    God uses the life-giving message of the gospel to strengthen believers to resist temptations to sin.

    神以福音坚固基督徒，拒绝罪恶的试探。

    We died to sin, how can we live in it any longer?  Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized in Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?  We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.…… In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus……Offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life……For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.  （Romans 6:2-4, 11, 13b, 14）

    我们在罪上死了的人，岂可仍在罪中活着呢？岂不知我们这受洗归入基督耶稣的人，是受洗归入他的死吗？所以我们藉着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，象基督藉着父的荣耀从死里复活一样…… 倒要象从死里复活的人，将自己献给　神，并将肢体作义的器具献给　神。……也不要将你们的肢体献给罪作不义的器具；罪必不能作你们的主，因你们不在律法之下，乃在恩典之下。（罗马书 6:2-4, 11, 13b, 14）

### C.    The Law And Gospel Work To Produce In Christians A Continued Contrition For Sin and A Continued Assurance Of Forgivness 律法与福音使基督徒持久地悔过，持久地坚信神的宽恕。

God uses His teachings of law and gospel to keep believers in Christ repentant for their sins and confident of God's forgiveness for them.

神以律法与福音的教导使基督徒保持一颗认罪悔改的心，同时也让他们对神的宽恕充满信心。

1.    God uses the convicting message of the law to show believers their sins and to keep them sincerely sorrowful for their sins.

    神以律法定罪审判的信息昭示基督徒的罪，使他们保持一颗真诚悔过的心。

    Yet, I hold this against you.  You have forsaken your first love.  Remember the height from which you have fallen!  Repent, and do the things you did at first.  If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lamp stand from its place. （Revelation 2:4-5）

    然而有一件事我要责备你，就是你把起初的爱心离弃了。所以应当回想你是从哪里坠落的，并要悔改，行起初所行的事。你若不悔改，我就临到你那里，把你的灯台从原处挪去。（启示录 2:4-5）

    I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot.  I wish you were one or the other!  So because you are lukewarm – neither hot, nor cold – I am about to spit you out of my mouth. . . Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline.  So be earnest, and repent. （Revelation 3:5-6, 19）

    我知道你的行为，你也不冷也不热；我巴不得你或冷或热。你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。凡我所疼爱的，我就责备管教他；所以你要发热心，也要悔改。（启示录 3:15-16, 19）

2.    God uses the comforting message of the gospel to assure contrite Christians that God forgives their sins.

    神以福音安慰体恤的信息使真心悔过的基督徒确信，神宽恕他们的罪。

    If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. （1 John 1:9）

    我们若认自己的罪，　神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义。（约翰一书 1:9）

    But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense – Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.  He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. （1 John 2:1b-2）

    若有人犯罪，在父那里我们有一位中保，就是那义者耶稣基督，他为我们的罪作了挽回祭，不是单为我们的罪，也是为普天下人的罪。（约翰一书 2:1b-2）

### D.    The Law And Gospel Work To Enable Christians To Produce God-Pleasing Good Works 律法与福音使基督徒有能力做蒙神喜悦的事

God uses His teachings of law and gospel to produce good works in the lives of Christians.

神律法与福音的教导在基督徒的生命中成就美善的事工。

1.    God uses the instructive message of the law to give Christians guidance to know the good things God wants them to do.

    神以律法启发性的信息引导基督徒了解神要他们去做的美善事工。

    Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.  Do not put out the Spirit's fire; do not treat prophecies with contempt.  Test everything.  Hold on to the good.  Avoid every kind of evil. （1 Thessalonians 5:16-22）

    要常常喜乐，不住地祷告，凡事谢恩，因为这是　神在基督耶稣里向你们所定的旨意。不要消灭圣灵的感动，不要藐视先知的讲论。但要凡事察验，善美的要持守；各样的恶事要禁戒不作。（帖撒罗尼迦前书 5:16-22）

2.    God uses the empowering message of the gospel to give Christians the desire and strength to do the good works that God desires.

    神以福音独具权能的信息赐予基督徒属灵的力量与渴望去做蒙神喜悦的事。

    But the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.  It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope – the glorious appearance of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for Himself a people who are His very own, eager to do what is good.  （Titus 2:11-14）

    因为　神救众人的恩典已经显明出来，教训我们除去不敬虔的心和世俗的情欲，在今世自守、公义、敬虔度日，等候所盼望的福，并等候至大的　神和我们救主耶稣基督的荣耀显现。他为我们舍了自己，要赎我们脱离一切罪恶，又洁净我们，特作自己的子民，热心为善。（提多书 2:11-14）

#### Recognizing How God Uses The Law And Gospel 辨别题：神如何使用律法与福音

Identify the way God uses the law and gospel to sanctify Christians in the following sections of Scripture:

在以下经文中定义神使用律法与福音圣洁化基督徒的方式。

1.    “But just as you excel in everything – in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us – see that you also excel in this grace of giving.  I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.  For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,  that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.” （2 Corinthians 8:7-9）

    你们既然在信心、口才、知识、热心和待我们的爱心上，都格外显出满足来，就当在这慈惠的事上也格外显出满足来。我说这话，不是吩咐你们，乃是藉着别人的热心试验你们爱心的实在。你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典：他本来富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷，可以成为富足。（哥林多后书8:7-9）

2.    “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.  Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.” （Ephesians 4:32-5:2）

    并要以恩慈相待，存怜悯的心，彼此饶恕，正如　神在基督里饶恕了你们一样。所以你们该效法　神，好象蒙慈爱的儿女一样。也要凭爱心行事，正如基督爱我们，为我们舍了自己，当作馨香的供物和祭物，献与　神。（以弗所书 4:32-5:2）

3.    “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.'  So we say with confidence, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.  What can man do to me?' Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you.  Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and tomorrow.”（Hebrews 13:5-8）

    你们存心不可贪爱钱财，要以自己所有的为足；因为主曾说：“我总不撇下你，也不丢弃你。” 所以我们可以放胆说：“主是帮助我的，我必不惧怕。人能把我怎么样呢？”从前引导你们、传　神之道给你们的人，你们要想念他们，效法他们的信心，留心看他们为人的结局。耶稣基督昨日今日，一直到永远，是一样的。（希伯来书 13:5-8）
