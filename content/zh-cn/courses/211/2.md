## A. God’s Believers Confess The Faith Together 基督徒们在一起共同认信

1. God wants His believers to confess the Christian faith individually.  He also wants them to confess the faith together as members of His spiritual family in the Christian Church on earth.

    神愿意基督徒们个人清楚的认信基督教的信仰。祂还愿意基督徒们作为地上教会的属灵成员能一同的认信他们的信仰。

2. As God unites people to Himself through faith in Jesus Christ, He also unites them with other people that He has brought to faith in Christ.   God creates the Church in order to have a special people who are His own and who glorify Him by their words and actions.  God leads His believers to join together in fellowship to obey His will and to confess Him in a variety of ways.

    神藉着在耶稣基督里的信心把人团聚在祂里面。祂还把他们和其他有共同信仰的基督徒们团聚在一起。神建立教会使属于祂的子民得以藉着他们的话语和行为来荣耀祂。神带领祂的信徒团契在一起来遵行祂的旨意，并用各样的方式来认信基督。

## B. God Wants His Christians To Be United In Believing And Following All That He Teaches In His Word 神希望祂的子民联合在同一信仰中，并且遵行所有祂所说的话语

20 But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, 21 keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. (Jude 20-21)

20 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们却要在至圣的真道上造就自己，在圣灵里祷告，21 保守自己常在　神的爱中，仰望我们主耶稣基督的怜悯，直到永生。（犹大书 20–21 )

To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. (John 8:31)

31 耶稣对信他的犹太人说：「你们若常常遵守我的道，就真是我的门徒；（约翰福音 8：31 )

19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” (Matthew 28:19-20)

19 所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。20 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。」（马太福音 28：19–20 )

10 I appeal to you, brothers and sisters] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought. (1 Corinthians 1:10)

10 弟兄们，我借我们主耶稣基督的名劝你们都说一样的话。你们中间也不可分党，只要一心一意，彼此相合。（哥林多前书 1：10 )

3 It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it. 4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth. (3 John 3-4)

3 有弟兄来证明你心里存的真理，正如你按真理而行，我就甚喜乐。4 我听见我的儿女们按真理而行，我的喜乐就没有比这个大的。（约翰三书 3–4 )

## C. God Wants His Believers To Express Their Unity In Faith Eagerly In The Fellowing Ways 神希望祂的子民在以下的方式里积极的表达他们在信仰中的合一

1. Publicly Worshipping God Together 一同公开的敬拜神

    25 Do not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching. (Hebrews 10:25)

    25 你们不可停止聚会，好像那些停止惯了的人，倒要彼此劝勉，既知道那日子临近，就更当如此。（希伯来书 10：25 )

2. Celebrating Holy Communion 一同分享圣餐

    17 Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf. (1 Corinthians 10:17)

    17 我们虽多，仍是一个饼，一个身体，因为我们都是分受这一个饼。（哥林多前书 10：17 )

3. Praying Together 一同祷告

    8 Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. (1 Timothy 2:8)

    8 我愿男人无忿怒，无争论，举起圣洁的手，随处祷告；（提摩太前书 2：8 )

    14 They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. (Acts 1:14)

    14 这些人同着几个妇人和耶稣的母亲马利亚，并耶稣的弟兄，都同心合意地恒切祷告。（使徒行传 1：14 )

4. Promoting The Faith By Preaching And Teaching and Baptizing 通过讲道、教导和洗礼来推广信仰

    19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” (Matthew 28:19-20)

    19 所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。20 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。」（马太福音 28：19–20 )

    8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (Acts 1:8)

    8 但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力，并要在耶路撒冷、犹太全地，和撒马利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。」（使徒行传 1：8 )

## D. God Warns Us That There Are People Inside Christian Churches On Earth That Are Not Faithful To God And Promote And Support Damaging False Teachings 神警告我们地上的教会中有人并不忠信于神并且还有传讲并支持有害的假教训

17 But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. 18 They said to you, “In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.” 19 These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit. (Jude 17-19)

17 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们要记念我们主耶稣基督之使徒从前所说的话。18 他们曾对你们说过，末世必有好讥诮的人随从自己不敬虔的私欲而行。19 这就是那些引人结党、属乎血气、没有圣灵的人。（犹大书 17–19 )

But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. 2 Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3 In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping. (2 Peter 2:1-3)

1 从前在百姓中有假先知起来，将来在你们中间也必有假师傅，私自引进陷害人的异端，连买他们的主他们也不承认，自取速速地灭亡。2 将有许多人随从他们邪淫的行为，便叫真道因他们的缘故被毁谤。3 他们因有贪心，要用捏造的言语在你们身上取利。他们的刑罚，自古以来并不迟延；他们的灭亡也必速速来到。（彼得后书 2：1–3 )

3 For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. (2 Timothy 4:3-4)

3 因为时候要到，人必厌烦纯正的道理，耳朵发痒，就随从自己的情欲，增添好些师傅，4 并且掩耳不听真道，偏向荒谬的言语。（提摩太后书 4：3–4 )

7 I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. 8 Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully. 9 Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. 11 Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.  (2 John 7-11)

7 因为世上有许多迷惑人的出来，他们不认耶稣基督是成了肉身来的；这就是那迷惑人、敌基督的。8 你们要小心，不要失去你们所做的工，乃要得着满足的赏赐。9 凡越过基督的教训不常守着的，就没有　神；常守这教训的，就有父又有子。10 若有人到你们那里，不是传这教训，不要接他到家里，也不要问他的安；11 因为问他安的，就在他的恶行上有分。（约翰二书 7–11 )

## E. God Teaches Us To Be Discerning And Careful About Our Association With Those Who Promote And Hold To False Teachings 神教导我们需要明辨且小心地处理我们和那些传讲假道理的人之间的关系

1. God Tells Us To Test All Those Who Teach A Spiritual Message To Make Sure That They Are Telling Us What His Word Teaches.

    神告诉我们说，需要试验那些传讲属灵信息的人，从而可以确切的知道他们是否在传讲圣经中的话语

    Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. (1 John 4:1)

    1 亲爱的弟兄啊，一切的灵，你们不可都信，总要试验那些灵是出于　神的不是，因为世上有许多假先知已经出来了。（约翰一书 4：1 )

2. God Teaches Us To Watch Out For False Teachers And Be Aware Of The Dangers They Present To Our Christian Faith

    神教导我们需要提放那些假教师，并且认识到他们对基督教信仰所造成的伤害

    15 “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 16 By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? (Matthew 7:15-16)

    15 「你们要防备假先知。他们到你们这里来，外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼。16 凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。荆棘上岂能摘葡萄呢？蒺藜里岂能摘无花果呢？（马太福音 7：15–16 )

3. God Tells Us To Avoid And To Separate Ourselves From Those Who Promote False Teachings

    神告诉我们说要避免且远离那些教导假教训的人

    17 I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. 18 For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.  (Romans 16:17-18)

    17 弟兄们，那些离间你们、叫你们跌倒、背乎所学之道的人，我劝你们要留意躲避他们。18 因为这样的人不服事我们的主基督，只服事自己的肚腹，用花言巧语诱惑那些老实人的心。（罗马书 16：17–18 )

4. God Also Teaches Us To Rebuke And If Necessary, Expel Those Who Might Try To Cause Spiritual Division With False Teaching In Our Church.

    神还教导我们必要时要指责他们，要驱逐那些可能试图在我们的教会中用错误的教导造成属灵分裂的人

    10 Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them. (Titus 3:10)

    10 分门结党的人，警戒过一两次，就要弃绝他。（提多书 3：10 )

## F. God Has Given Us Sound, Loving Reasons To Oppose And Separate FromThose Who Do Not Faithfully Follow His Word 上帝已经给了我们合理的、充满爱心的理由，让我们抵挡并与那些不忠实于他的话语的人分开

1. We Are To Separate Out Of Love For God And His True Word

    我们要出于对上帝的爱和祂的真道的缘故而分离

    17 Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. (John 17:17) 17

    求你用真理使他们成圣；你的道就是真理。（约翰福音 17：17 )

    4 For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about[a] long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord. (Jude 4)

    23 Jesus replied, “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. 24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.  (John 14:23-24)

    ²³ 耶稣回答说：「人若爱我，就必遵守我的道；我父也必爱他，并且我们要到他那里去，与他同住。²⁴ 不爱我的人就不遵守我的道。你们所听见的道不是我的，乃是差我来之父的道。（约翰福音 14：23–24)

2. We Are To Separate Out Of Love For Those Who Hold To The Truth, Including Ourselves.

    我们要出于对那些坚持真理的人的爱而分离，包括爱我们自己。

    3 But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. (2 Corinthians 11:3)

    3 我只怕你们的心或偏于邪，失去那向基督所存纯一清洁的心，就像蛇用诡诈诱惑了夏娃一样。（哥林多后书 11：3 )

    17 Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position. (2 Peter 3:17)

    17 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们既然预先知道这事，就当防备，恐怕被恶人的错谬诱惑，就从自己坚固的地步上坠落。（彼得后书 3：17 )

3. We Are To Separate Out Of Love For Those Who Are Caught Up In False Belief.

    我们要出于对那些陷入错误信仰的人的爱而分离

    13 This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith 14 and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth. (Titus 1:13-14)

    13 这个见证是真的。所以，你要严严地责备他们，使他们在真道上纯全无疵，14 不听犹太人荒谬的言语和离弃真道之人的诫命。（提多书 1：13–14 )

    22 Be merciful to those who doubt; (Jude 22)

    22 有些人存疑心，你们要怜悯他们；（犹大书 22 )

    19 My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, 20 remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins. (James 5:19-20)

    19 我的弟兄们，你们中间若有失迷真道的，有人使他回转，20 这人该知道：叫一个罪人从迷路上转回便是救一个灵魂不死，并且遮盖许多的罪。（雅各书 5：19–20 )
