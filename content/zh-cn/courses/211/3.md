1. God uses His life-giving Word through which the Holy Spirit works to create Christians who believe the Word and confess that Word with their own words.  (2 Thessalonians 2:13-14, Romans 10:17, 1 Corinthians 12:3)

    藉着圣灵的工作，神用祂的生命之道创造出相信这道并且自己的话语认信这道的基督徒。

    13 But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. 14 He called you to this through our gospel,  that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  (2 Thessalonians 2:13-14)

    13 主所爱的弟兄们哪，我们本该常为你们感谢　神；因为他从起初拣选了你们，叫你们因信真道，又被圣灵感动，成为圣洁，能以得救。14 神借我们所传的福音召你们到这地步，好得着我们主耶稣基督的荣光。（帖撒罗尼迦后书 2：13–14 )

    17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. (Romans 10:17)

    17 可见，信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。（罗马书 10：17 )

    3 Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit. (1 Corinthians 12:3)

    3 所以我告诉你们，被　神的灵感动的，没有说「耶稣是可咒诅」的；若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说「耶稣是主」的。（哥林多前书 12：3 )
2. God calls and moves His Christians to publicly proclaim (confess) their religious beliefs in a variety of ways:

    神呼召并感动他的基督徒以各种方式公开宣布（承认）他们的宗教信仰。

    a. In worship as Christians confess their sins (Psalm 51:3-4), declare God’s praises (Psalm 51:15), and confess their faith (Psalm 51:13).

    在敬拜中作为基督徒来承认自己的罪（诗篇51:3-4)，传扬赞美神的话 (诗篇51:15), 并且认信他们的信仰 (诗篇51:13).

    For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. 4 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight; so you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge. Psalm 51:3-4)

    3 因为，我知道我的过犯； 我的罪常在我面前。 4 我向你犯罪，惟独得罪了你； 在你眼前行了这恶， 以致你责备我的时候显为公义， 判断我的时候显为清正。（诗篇 51：3–4 )

    Open my lips, Lord, and my mouth will declare your praise. (Psalm 51:15)

    15 主啊，求你使我嘴唇张开， 我的口便传扬赞美你的话！（诗篇 51：15 )

    Then I will teach transgressors your ways, so that sinners will turn back to you.(Psalm 51:13)

    13 我就把你的道指教有过犯的人， 罪人必归顺你。（诗篇 51：13 )

    b. In preaching (哥林多后书 4：5) 在讲道中

    For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. (2 Corinthians 4:5)

    5 我们原不是传自己，乃是传基督耶稣为主，并且自己因耶稣作你们的仆人。（哥林多后书 4：5 )

    c. In teaching (Matthew 28:20a) 在教导中

    teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. (Matthew 28:20a)

    20 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。」（马太福音 28：20a )

    d. In witnessing  (1 Peter 3:15) 在见证中

    But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, (1 Peter 3:15)

    15 只要心里尊主基督为圣。有人问你们心中盼望的缘由，就要常作准备，以温柔、敬畏的心回答各人；（彼得前书 3：15 )

    e. In the use of the Keys (John 20:21-23 在使用钥匙职时

    21 Again Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” 22 And with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive anyone’s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.” (John 20:21-23)

    21 耶稣又对他们说：「愿你们平安！父怎样差遣了我，我也照样差遣你们。」22 说了这话，就向他们吹一口气，说：「你们受圣灵！23 你们赦免谁的罪，谁的罪就赦免了；你们留下谁的罪，谁的罪就留下了。」（约翰福音 20：21–23 )

3. God’s Word, the Bible, is the only source and standard for the teachings that Christians are to believe and to confess.   (2 Timothy 3:14-17, Jeremiah 23:28)

    上帝的话语，即圣经，是基督徒要相信和认信的教导的唯一来源和标准。  

    14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, 15 and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17 so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:14-17)

    14 但你所学习的，所确信的，要存在心里；因为你知道是跟谁学的，15 并且知道你是从小明白圣经，这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣，有得救的智慧。16 圣经都是　神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的，17 叫属　神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。（提摩太后书 3：14–17 )

    28 Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the LORD. (Jeremiah 23:28)

    28 得梦的先知可以述说那梦；得我话的人可以诚实讲说我的话。糠秕怎能与麦子比较呢？这是耶和华说的。」（耶利米书 23：28 )

4. An important way that Christians confess their faith is through the use of carefully written Biblical statements or documents.   These written confessions have these characteristics:  They are:

    基督徒认信其信仰的一个重要方式是通过使用精心编写的信仰陈述或文件。这些书面的忏悔有以下特点：

    a. orderly in structure
    b. a summary of key teachings/principles
    c. fixed in their wording
    d. Biblical – drawing their teachings solely and clearly from the Bible
    e. evangelical – centered in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
    f. evangelistic – intended to proclaim truth to others
    g. ecumenical – representing the faith of the one true Holy Christian Church
    h. eschatalogical – accountable to God’s judgment and filled with urgency

    a. 合理的结构
    b. 对关键教导/原则进行总结
    c. 措辞固定
    d. 符合圣经--完全明确地从圣经中汲取其教义
    e. 福音式的--以耶稣基督的福音为中心
    f. 布道式的--旨在向他人宣扬真理
    g. 普世的--代表唯一的圣而公之教会的信仰
    h. 末世论的—要经受上帝的审判，充满紧迫感

5. Christian confession requires condemning false religious teachings and practices as well as affirming Biblical truths. (2 Corinthians 6:14-15; 10:5)

    基督徒的认信要求谴责错误的宗教教义和做法，并肯定圣经中的真理。

    14 Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 15 What harmony is there between Christ and Belial[a]? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? (2 Corinthians 6:14-15)

    14 你们和不信的原不相配，不要同负一轭。义和不义有什么相交呢？光明和黑暗有什么相通呢？15 基督和彼列有什么相和呢？信主的和不信主的有什么相干呢？（哥林多后书 6：14–15 )

    5 We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. (2 /Corinthians 10:5)

    5 将各样的计谋，各样拦阻人认识　神的那些自高之事，一概攻破了，又将人所有的心意夺回，使他都顺服基督。（哥林多后书 10：5 )

6. There are a number of important reasons for having and using written Biblical confessions.

    使用书面的认信文件有许多重要原因

    a. They provide beneficial summaries of Christian teaching.
    b. They proclaim and impart the truths of God’s Word to people.
    c. They distinguish and separate God’s truth from human, devil-inspired errors and heresies.
    d. They establish and preserve the Christian faith of God’s believers.
    e. They give praise and honor to God.
    f. They serve as useful secondary sources of authority to help solve disputes or misunderstandings about the meaning of Scripture.  

    a. 它们提供了基督教教导的有益总结。
    b. 它们向人们宣扬和传授神的话语的真理。
    c. 它们将神的真理与从人而来、受魔鬼启发的错误和异端邪说区分开来。
    d. 它们建立和维护神的信徒的基督教信仰。
    e. 它们将赞美和荣耀献给神。
    f. 它们可以作为有用的次要权威，来帮助解决对圣经经文的含义的争议或误解。

7. Specific formulations of confessions depend on a variety of matters such as: current issues that Christians are facing; historical developments; and the cultural context in which people live.  (Acts 15:1-31)

    认信的具体形式取决于各种因素，如：基督徒目前面临的问题；历史发展；以及人们生活的文化背景。

    15 Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.” 2 This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. 3 The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad. 4 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.

    5 Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.”  6 The apostles and elders met to consider this question. 7 After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. 8 God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. 9 He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. 10 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? 11 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”  

    12 The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. 13 When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me. 14 Simon[a] has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles. 15 The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:
    16 “‘After this I will return and rebuild David’s fallen tent Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it, 17 that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things ]— 18things known from long ago.  19 “It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. 20 Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. 21 For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”

    22 Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers. 23 With them they sent the following letter:

    The apostles and elders, your brothers,  To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia:

    Greetings.

    24 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. 25 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul— 26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. 28 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: 29 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.

    30 So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter. 31 The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. (Acts 15:1-31)

    1 有几个人从犹太下来，教训弟兄们说：「你们若不按摩西的规条受割礼，不能得救。」2 保罗、巴拿巴与他们大大地纷争辩论；众门徒就定规，叫保罗、巴拿巴和本会中几个人，为所辩论的，上耶路撒冷去见使徒和长老。3 于是教会送他们起行。他们经过腓尼基、撒马利亚，随处传说外邦人归主的事，叫众弟兄都甚欢喜。4 到了耶路撒冷，教会和使徒并长老都接待他们，他们就述说　神同他们所行的一切事。5 惟有几个信徒是法利赛教门的人，起来说：「必须给外邦人行割礼，吩咐他们遵守摩西的律法。」 6 使徒和长老聚会商议这事；7 辩论已经多了，彼得就起来，说：「诸位弟兄，你们知道　神早已在你们中间拣选了我，叫外邦人从我口中得听福音之道，而且相信。8 知道人心的　神也为他们作了见证，赐圣灵给他们，正如给我们一样；9 又借着信洁净了他们的心，并不分他们我们。10 现在为什么试探　神，要把我们祖宗和我们所不能负的轭放在门徒的颈项上呢？11 我们得救乃是因主耶稣的恩，和他们一样，这是我们所信的。」 12 众人都默默无声，听巴拿巴和保罗述说　神借他们在外邦人中所行的神迹奇事。13 他们住了声，雅各就说：「诸位弟兄，请听我的话。14 方才西门述说　神当初怎样眷顾外邦人，从他们中间选取百姓归于自己的名下；15 众先知的话也与这意思相合。16 正如经上所写的： 此后，我要回来， 重新修造大卫倒塌的帐幕， 把那破坏的重新修造建立起来， 17 叫余剩的人， 就是凡称为我名下的外邦人， 都寻求主。 18 这话是从创世以来显明这事的主说的。 19 「所以据我的意见，不可难为那归服　神的外邦人；20 只要写信，吩咐他们禁戒偶像的污秽和奸淫，并勒死的牲畜和血。21 因为从古以来，摩西的书在各城有人传讲，每逢安息日，在会堂里诵读。」 22 那时，使徒和长老并全教会定意从他们中间拣选人，差他们和保罗、巴拿巴同往安提阿去；所拣选的就是称呼巴撒巴的犹大和西拉。这两个人在弟兄中是作首领的。23 于是写信交付他们，内中说：「使徒和作长老的弟兄们问安提阿、叙利亚、基利家外邦众弟兄的安。24 我们听说，有几个人从我们这里出去，用言语搅扰你们，惑乱你们的心。其实我们并没有吩咐他们。25 所以，我们同心定意，拣选几个人，差他们同我们所亲爱的巴拿巴和保罗往你们那里去。26 这二人是为我主耶稣基督的名不顾性命的。27 我们就差了犹大和西拉，他们也要亲口诉说这些事。28 因为圣灵和我们定意不将别的重担放在你们身上，惟有几件事是不可少的，29 就是禁戒祭偶像的物和血，并勒死的牲畜和奸淫。这几件你们若能自己禁戒不犯就好了。愿你们平安！」 30 他们既奉了差遣，就下安提阿去，聚集众人，交付书信。31 众人念了，因为信上安慰的话就欢喜了。（使徒行传 15：1–31 )

8. Differences in faith and knowledge affect the degree to which Christians can confess the faith.  For example, those who are blessed with a greater faith and knowledge or more personal freedom will be able to confess to a more extensive and clearer degree to the truths of God’s Word than those with a lesser faith and knowledge or less personal freedom.   (Matthew 13:23)

    信心和知识的差异会影响基督徒对信仰的认信程度。 例如，那些有更大信心和知识或更多个人自由的人，将能够比那些信心和知识较少或个人自由较少的人更广泛和更清晰地承认神的话语的真理。  

    23 But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”(Matthew 13:23)

    23 撒在好地上的，就是人听道明白了，后来结实，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。」（马太福音 13：23 )

9. Confessors of the Christian faith are to make their confession in a manner that is pleasing to God and suitable for the occasion.  God calls on His Christians to confess:

    基督教信仰的认信者要以神所喜悦的方式和适合的场合进行认信。 神呼召祂的基督徒如此认信：

    a. clearly and intelligibly   (1 Corinthians 14:8-9) 清楚明白地

    8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. (1 Corinthians 14:8-9)

    8 若吹无定的号声，谁能预备打仗呢？9 你们也是如此。舌头若不说容易明白的话，怎能知道所说的是什么呢？这就是向空说话了。（哥林多前书 14：8–9 )

    b. truthfully  (2 Corinthians 2:17, 4:2;  Ephesians 4:15) 诚实地

    17 Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God. (2 Corinthians 2:17)

    17 我们不像那许多人，为利混乱　神的道；乃是由于诚实，由于　神，在　神面前凭着基督讲道。（哥林多后书 2：17 )

    2 Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God. (2 Corinthians 4:2)

    2 乃将那些暗昧可耻的事弃绝了；不行诡诈，不谬讲　神的道理，只将真理表明出来，好在　神面前把自己荐与各人的良心。（哥林多后书 4：2 )

    15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. (Ephesians 4:15)

    15 惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督，（以弗所书 4：15 )

    c. lovingly    (2 Corinthians 6:11; Ephesians 4:15) 有爱地

    11 We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.(2 Corinthians 6:11)

    11 哥林多人哪，我们向你们，口是张开的，心是宽宏的。（哥林多后书 6：11 )

    15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. (Ephesians 4:15)

    15 惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督，（以弗所书 4：15 )

    d. gently and respectfully, not harshly and contentiously   (2 Timothy 2:24-26; 1 Peter 3:15b-16) 温和恭敬地，而不是严厉地，有争议地

    24 And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. 25 Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, 26 and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will. (2 Timothy 2:24-26)

    24 然而主的仆人不可争竞，只要温温和和地待众人，善于教导，存心忍耐，25 用温柔劝戒那抵挡的人；或者　神给他们悔改的心，可以明白真道，26 叫他们这已经被魔鬼任意掳去的，可以醒悟，脱离他的网罗。（提摩太后书 2：24–26 )

    15 But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 16 keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. (1 Peter 3:15b-16)

    16 存着无亏的良心，叫你们在何事上被毁谤，就在何事上可以叫那诬赖你们在基督里有好品行的人自觉羞愧。（彼得前书 3：15b–16 )

    e. bravely and perseveringly   (2 Timothy 4:2,5) 勇敢，锲而不舍地

    2 Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction. .  . 5 But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.  (2 Timothy 4:2,5)

    2 务要传道，无论得时不得时总要专心，并用百般的忍耐、各样的教训责备人，警戒人，劝勉人。5 你却要凡事谨慎，忍受苦难，做传道的工夫，尽你的职分。（提摩太后书 4：2，5 )

10. Those who faithfully confess the Christian faith should expect that they will face some form of hardship or persecution from the enemies of God.  (2 Timothy 2:3; 3:12; Philippians 1:29)

    3 Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. (2 Timothy 2:3)

    那些忠实地认信基督教信仰的人应该预料到，他们将更多的面临某些来自上帝敌人的艰难或迫害。

    12 In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, (2 Timothy 3:12)

    12 不但如此，凡立志在基督耶稣里敬虔度日的也都要受逼迫。（提摩太后书 3：12 )

    29 For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, (Philippians 1:29)

    29 因为你们蒙恩，不但得以信服基督，并要为他受苦。（腓立比书 1：29 )

11. Confessors of the Christian faith can also be comforted and strengthened by the knowledge that God will support them through their trials and ultimately deliver them from all earthly pain and loss.   (Hebrews 10:23, 32-39)

    基督教信仰的认信者也会得到安慰和力量，因为他们知道上帝将支持他们度过考验，并最终将他们从所有世上的痛苦和损失中解救出来。  

    23 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. (Hebrews 10:23)

    23 也要坚守我们所承认的指望，不至摇动，因为那应许我们的是信实的。（希伯来书 10：23 )

    32 Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering. 33 Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. 34 You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. 35 So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. 36 You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. 37 For, “In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay”  38 And, “But my righteous one will live by faith.  And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back.”  39 But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved. (Hebrews 10:32-39)

    32 你们要追念往日，蒙了光照以后所忍受大争战的各样苦难：33 一面被毁谤，遭患难，成了戏景，叫众人观看；一面陪伴那些受这样苦难的人。34 因为你们体恤了那些被捆锁的人，并且你们的家业被人抢去，也甘心忍受，知道自己有更美长存的家业。35 所以，你们不可丢弃勇敢的心；存这样的心必得大赏赐。36 你们必须忍耐，使你们行完了　神的旨意，就可以得着所应许的。 37 因为还有一点点时候， 那要来的就来，并不迟延； 38 只是义人必因信得生。 他若退后，我心里就不喜欢他。 39 我们却不是退后入沉沦的那等人，乃是有信心以致灵魂得救的人。（希伯来书 10：32–39 )

12. A Confessing Christian is a Biblical Christian.  A Biblical Christian is one who believes that Jesus Christ is his Savior from sin and eternal death.   He believes that the Bible is the true Word of God and accepts the Bible as the only source of spiritual authority and belief.  He also believes that people are saved as a gift of God’s undeserved love through faith in the redeeming work of Jesus Christ apart from their own works.  He also accepts the doctrines taught in written Christian confessions that are completely faithful to the teachings of the Bible.  In faithfulness to the teachings of the Bible, this person is diligent to make sure that the true, Biblical Christian faith is actually preached, taught and put into practice.  Some of the major, faithful written confessions are:  

    认信的基督徒是一个信仰符合圣经的基督徒。 这样的基督徒是相信耶稣基督是使他脱离罪恶和永恒死亡的救主。  他相信《圣经》是上帝的真话，并接受《圣经》作为属灵权威和信心的唯一来源。 他还相信，人们通过对耶稣基督救赎工作的信仰而得救，救恩是上帝所赐的，人不配得的爱的礼物，与人自己的行为无关。 他还接受基督教认信文件中所教导的教义，认可这些教义完全忠实于圣经的教导。 为了忠于《圣经》的教导，基督徒要勤勉地确保真正的、符合《圣经》的基督教信仰确实的被传讲、教导并付诸实践。 一些主要的、忠实的基督教认信文件包括：

    1) The Apostles’ Creed 使徒信经
    2) The Nicene Creed 尼西亚信经
    3) The Athanasian Creed 亚那他修信经
    4) Martin Luther’s Small Catechism马丁路德小教理问答
    5) Martin Luther’s Large Catechism 马丁路德大教理问答
    6) The Augsburg Confession 奥格斯堡信条
    7) The Apology (Defense) of the Augsburg Confession 奥格斯堡信条辩护书
    8) The Smalcald Articles 施马加登条款
    9) The Formula of Concord 协同书
