## INTRODUCTION 介绍

Abram was 86 years old when Ishmael was born. Now 13 more years had passed and Sarai was still barren. It may have seemed to Abram that Ishmael was going to be the heir of the promise. But now the Lord will make it absolutely certain that Abram and Sarai will have a son of their own through whom all of God’s promises will be kept. God makes it certain by confirming the covenant that was made in chapter 15.

以实玛利出生时，亚伯兰86岁。现在又过了13年，撒莱仍然没有怀孕。亚伯兰可能以为，以实玛利就是那位应许的后裔。但现在，耶和华要让他们确知，亚伯兰和撒莱将要有一个他们自己的儿子，而且神的所有应许将在这个儿子身上得以成就。神在第15章中通过确保这一应许而使之变得明确。

In verse 2 God says that he is going to “confirm” the covenant that he had already made with Abraham. In chapter 15 only God bound himself to the covenant by passing through the severed animals, but now God requires Abram to bind himself to the covenant promises by undergoing the bloody operation of circumcision.

在第2节中，神说他将“确保”他已经与亚伯拉罕订立的盟约。在第15章中，神通过从劈开的动物中间经过来表明他会信守这约中的承诺，但现在神要亚伯兰通过接受血腥的割礼来谨守这约的承诺。

READ GENESIS 17:1–8 读创世记 17:1–8

In this chapter we will learn that God gave special covenant names to both Abram (“Abraham”) and Sarai (“Sarah”).  God also used a special covenant name for himself in verse 1. He called himself “God Almighty” (El Shaddai).

在这一章中，我们将看到神给亚伯兰（“亚伯拉罕”)和撒莱(“萨拉”）起了特殊的盟约名。神也在第1节中为自己使用了一个特殊的盟约名。他称自己是“全能的神”(ElShaddai伊勒沙代)。

1. Why did God teach Abram this special name for the God who makes covenant promises?

   神为什么教导亚伯兰认识这是那位做出盟约承诺之神的特殊名字？

2. Though it might seem ridiculous that Abraham and Sarah would still have a child in such old age (Abraham was 99 years old and Sarah was 89 years old), and it might seem even more ridiculous that they would have many descendants because Sarah had never been able to have even one child, God wanted them to know and believe that he can do all things. He who makes such promises, seemingly so hard to keep, is able to keep them. He is God ALMIGHTY.

    虽然说亚伯拉罕和萨拉在这么老的年级（亚伯拉罕99岁，莎拉89岁）将会有一个孩子似乎很荒谬，而且在萨拉连一个孩子都没有的情况下说他们还将会有很多后裔似乎更荒谬，但神想让他们知道并且相信，他可以做任何事情。做出如此应许的那一位，面对似乎难以兑现的承诺，是那位能够遵守承诺的神。他是全能的神。

    When an angel told the virgin Mary that she would conceive and give birth to a child, she asked, “How can this be since I am a virgin?” The angel told her, “Nothing is impossible with God” (Luke 1:37).

    当一个天使对童贞女马利亚说她将怀孕并生下一个孩子时，她问：“我还没有出嫁，怎么能有这事呢？”天使对她说：“在神没有难成的事。”（原文：出于神的话，没有一句不带能力的。）（路加福音1：37）。

    And when the disciples, learning how hard it is to be saved, asked Jesus, “Who can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:26). God is Almighty. He can make a great nation of old and barren people. God is Almighty. He can save sinful people through the death of his Son.  

    而且当门徒了解到得救有多困难时，他们问耶稣：“那谁能得救呢？”耶稣看着他们说：“在人这是不能的，在神凡事都能。”（马太福音19：26）。神是全能的，他能让一群又老又不能生育的人成为一个大国。神是全能的，他能透过他儿子的死来拯救有罪的人。

3. In these verses God repeats the covenant promises to which he bound himself in chapter 15. What were those promises to which God bound himself to keep?

    在这些经文中，上帝重复了他在第15章中将自己绑在其中的盟约中的应许。在他自己将信守的盟约中，神应许了哪些事情？

    Verse 4 第4节

    Verse 7 第7节

    Verse 8 第8节

4. Why does God repeat the covenant promises over and over again?

    上帝为什么要一遍一遍地重复那个盟约的应许？

    Abraham believed the Lord, but Abraham’s faith needed nurturing and reassurance, just like our faith needs constant nurturing and reassurance, not just because time and stuff can make us forget, but also because our sins can make us wonder if God still loves us.

    亚伯拉罕相信主，但亚伯拉罕的信心需要滋养和再次确保，就像我们的信心也需要不断的滋养和再次确保一样，这不仅因为时间和事物会让我们忘记，也因为我们的罪会让我们怀疑上帝是否仍然爱我们。

    So we come gather to hear God’s word week after week so that God can nurture our faith. “Tell us that old story of Your love, dear Lord. We need Your reassurance that You still love us. We fail You so often, we make such a mess of things, and we might wonder, Do You still love me? Will You still care for me?” We want to hear the same Gospel promises of His love for us in Christ Jesus. We need to hear it again and again.

    所以我们需要一周接一周地聚在一起听神的话语，让神来培育我们的信心。“亲爱的主，请把那关于你爱我们的老故事讲给我们听吧。我们需要你的再次保证，确知你仍然爱我们。我们经常辜负你，我们把事情弄得一团糟，我们可能会想，你还爱我吗？你还会关心我吗？”我们想要听到他在耶稣基督里把他的爱赐给我们的那个同样的福音应许。我们需要一遍一遍地听到它。

5. Why did God change Abram’s name?

    上帝为什么要为亚伯兰改名？

    In verse 8 the phrase “everlasting possession” (the English translation) makes it sound as if the land of Canaan would always belong to the Hebrew people descended from Abraham. However, the Hebrew phrase here can also be translated “for a long indefinite period of time” (rather than “everlasting”). We would prefer that alternate translation because in Genesis 15:13-16 the Lord had made it clear that Abraham’s descendants would not live in the land of Canaan for a period of 400 years. It’s important that we remember that the land of Canaan was important to the promise because this was the land chosen to be the home of the promised Savior who would bring God’s blessing to every family and nation on earth – the blessing of forgiveness of sins.  

    创世纪第17章8节中的“永远为业”（永远的产业）听起来好像迦南的土地会永远属于作为亚伯拉罕后裔的希伯来人。但这个希伯来词也可以译为“一段很长的无期限的时间”（而不是“永远”）。我们更喜欢另一种翻译，因为在《创世纪》15：13-16中，主明确表示亚伯拉罕的后裔不会在迦南住400年。重要的是，我们要记住，迦南地对应许很重要，因为神选择让那位应许要来的救主在这片土地上出生，他将把神的祝福带给地上的每个家庭和民族，就是罪得赦免的祝福。

    READ GENESIS 17:9–14 阅读创世记17：9-14

6. Why did God determine that male circumcision would be the way for Abraham and his descendants to keep the covenant with the Lord?

    上帝为什么决定让亚伯拉罕和他的后代用男性受割礼的方式来遵守与主之间的约定？

7. In verse 14 God said that “Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.” What does it mean to be “cut off” from God’s people? See Exodus 31:14.

    在第14节中，神说：“但不受割礼的男子必从民中剪除，因他背了我的约。”被从上帝的子民中“剪除”是什么意思？参见出埃及记31：14。

    出31:14： 所以你们要守安息日，以为圣日。凡干犯这日的，必要把他治死；凡在这日做工的，必从民中剪除。

8. Agree or disagree. Circumcision no longer has any religious meaning or value. (See Galatians 5:1-6 and explain your answer.)

    同意或不同意。割礼不再有任何宗教意义或价值。（参见加拉太书5：1-6，并解释你的答案。）

    READ GENESIS 17:15–22 阅读创世记17：15-22

9. Why did God change Sarai’s name?

    上帝为什么要给撒莱改名字？

    In verse 17 we read that Abraham laughed when he heard God’s promise that he and Sarah would have a son. As he and Sarah grew older, it seemed more and more impossible for God to do what He had promised. It didn’t make any sense, and it didn’t seem realistic. Can God really do this?

    在第十七节中我们看到，亚伯拉罕听到上帝应许他和萨拉将有一个儿子时就笑了。随着他和萨拉的年龄日渐增长，让神来成就他所应许的事似乎越来越不可能。因为讲不通，也似乎很不现实。上帝真的能做到吗？

    People have often laughed at God’s declarations. When Zechariah was told he would have a son, he wouldn’t believe it. On Easter when the women told the disciples that Jesus had risen, we read that the disciples thought it was nonsense. People have always had trouble with this truth. Some don’t think it possible for a virgin to have a baby. Some don’t think it is possible for Jesus to physically rise to life after three days in the tomb.

    人们经常嘲笑上帝的宣告。当撒迦利亚被告知他将有一个儿子时，他也不相信。在复活日那天，当妇女们告诉门徒说耶稣已经复活的时候，我们看到，门徒以为她们在胡说八道。人们对这个真理总是有问题。有些人认为处女不可能生孩子。有些人认为耶稣已经在坟墓里待了三天，不可能复活了。

    What seems ridiculous to you? What are you struggling to believe?

    你认为可笑的是什么呢？你很难相信的是什么？

    • That Jesus is the only way a person can get to heaven?

    Remember the word of the Lord: “I am God Almighty. I can do what seems too hard for you. I can …

    记住耶和华神的话：“我是全能的神。我能做对你来说似乎太难的事。我可以---

    Lord, we believe. Help us overcome our unbelief.

10. Both Isaac and Ishmael were sons of Abraham. What was different about the two?

    以撒和以实玛利都是亚伯拉罕的儿子。这两者有什么不同呢？

    READ GENESIS 17:23–27 阅读创世记17:23-27

11. How does Abraham’s response to God’s command demonstrate his faith in God’s word and promises?

    亚伯拉罕对神的命令做出的回应怎样证明了他对神话语和应许的信心？

Now that we believe God’s word and promises, the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. And, so as a sign that Abraham was a believer and a recipient of God’s gracious promises, God established the covenant of circumcision.

我们既然相信了神的话语和应许，唯一重要的就是透过爱表达出来的信心。因此，为了表明亚伯拉罕相信神，并且成为接受神恩典应许的接受者，神设立了割礼之约。

This circumcision was not a matter of hygiene or better health. It was a flesh and blood expression of faith. Let me repeat: It was a flesh and blood expression of faith. Commenting on this St. Paul wrote: “[Abraham] received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith” (Romans 4:11).

这种割礼不是一个有关卫生或更健康的问题，而是一个用血和肉来表现的信心。让我再说一遍：这是一个用血和肉来表现的信心。使徒保罗对此做过评论，他说：“亚伯拉罕受了割礼的记号，作他因信称义的印证”（罗马书4：11）。

The Lord asked Abraham and all who shared his faith to demonstrate their faith and love for Him by an act of obedience: Be circumcised. This was a flesh and blood expression of faith. This would not be easy, as the operation would be painful and bloody (at least for the men). “If you believe my promises, and if you love me, then you will be circumcised” God said. This would mean that being part of the community of believers would have a significant commitment, a flesh and blood commitment, a clear expression of faith and love for God.

主要求亚伯拉罕和所有与他有同样信心的人通过顺服的行动来证实他们对他的信心和爱——神要他们行割礼。这是一种用血和肉来表明信心的方式。这并不容易，因为手术会痛苦而且要流血（至少对男性来说是这样）。“如果你相信我的应许，如果你爱我，那么你就要接受割礼。”神说。这意味着，作为信徒群体的一份子就要有重大的委身和承诺，一种血和肉的委身（奉献和投入），一种对神做出的明确的信心和爱的表示。

Today circumcision no longer counts. However, what does count is faith expressing itself through love and obedience to God.

今天，割礼已经不再重要了，重要的是透过对神的爱和顺服表示出来的信心。

The significance of this act of obedience was made clear in the New Testament record when Stephen told the unbelieving Israelites: “You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!” (Acts 7:51, NIV84). An “uncircumcised heart” is a heart that does not love Jesus and obey Him. An “uncircumcised ear” is one that does not listen to the words of Jesus. So circumcision represents repentance, faith, and obedience. It represents faith expressing itself through love.

这种顺服行动的重要性在新约的记录中就有明确的说明。当时司提反对不信的以色列人说：“你们这硬着颈项，心与耳未受割礼的人！时常抗拒圣灵；你们的祖宗怎样，你们也怎样。”（使徒行传：第7章51节，NIV84）。一个“未受割礼的心”是一颗不爱耶稣并服从耶稣的心。“未受割礼的耳朵”是一种不听耶稣话语的耳朵。所以割礼代表着悔改、相信和服从。它代表通过爱表现出来的信心。

A chicken and a pig were walking down the street one day and noticed some poor children who looked like they were starving. Moved with compassion, the chicken said to the pig, “I have an idea! Let’s give those children a nice breakfast of ham and eggs.” The pig thought about the suggestion a moment, and said, “Well, that’s a good idea, but for you it would involve only a small sacrifice. But for me, it would involve total commitment.”

一天，一只鸡和一头猪在街上走，他们注意到一些可怜的孩子，他们看起来好像快要饿死了。鸡内心充满同情，便对猪说：“我有个主意！”让我们给那些孩子提供一顿火腿和鸡蛋的美味早餐吧。”猪把这个提议想了一会儿，然后说：“嗯，那是个好主意，但你只需要做出很小的一点牺牲，而我却需要将自己完全投入进去。”

That’s what the Lord was teaching Abraham and all of us. In establishing His covenant of grace with us, God made a total commitment. His love was expressed in flesh and blood. And at the communion altar He assures us that His blood was spilled for us for our forgiveness.  

这就是主教导亚伯拉罕和我们所有人的真理。在他与我们建立的恩典之约中，神作出了完全的委身和投入。他的爱用血和肉表示了出来。在圣餐的祭坛上，他向我们确保，他的血为我们流出，使我们得赦免。

Now faith asks us to respond to His love by loving and obeying Him in return. Make a flesh and blood commitment. Don’t just say you are a Christian. Put your faith into practice and express it by loving God and showing love and kindness to those around you.

现在，信心要求我们通过爱与对他的顺服来回应他对我们的爱。做出有血有肉的委身，不要只说你是一个基督徒。将你的信心付诸行动，通过爱神并向周围的人表达爱与良善的方式把你的信心表现出来。
