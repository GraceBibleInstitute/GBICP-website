## INTRODUCTION 简介

The first eleven verses of chapter 25 will complete the story of Abraham. However, the events recorded toward the end of the chapter probably also occurred during Abraham’s long life. Verse 7 tells us that “Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.” Since Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old, this would mean that Isaac was 75 years old when his father died. And we know that Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah (Genesis 25:20) and 60 years old when Jacob and Esau were born (Genesis 25:26). Therefore, Jacob and Esau were 15 years old when their grandfather Abraham died.

第25章的前11节是亚伯拉罕故事的完结。不过，直到本章结束所记录的事件可能也发生在亚伯拉罕活着的时候。第7节告诉我们“亚伯拉罕一生的年日是一百七十五岁”。以撒出生的时候，亚伯拉罕一百岁，所以父亲去世的时候，以撒已经七十五岁了。我们也知道，以撒娶利百加的时候年四十（创25:20），雅各和以扫出生的时候以撒六十岁（创25:26）。所以，当他们的爷爷亚伯拉罕去世的时候，雅各和以扫已经十五岁了。![创25](/static/course-file/106/106-9-1.png)

READ GENESIS 25:1-11 阅读创25:1-11

We know very little about Keturah except that she became Abraham’s wife after the death of Sarah and bore him six sons. Verse 6 and 1 Chronicles 1:32 (“The sons born to Keturah, Abraham’s concubine”) indicate that she was a “concubine” which would indicate that she had lower social status than Sarah did. The fact that the word “concubine” is plural may be an indication that Keturah was not the only woman that gave birth to Abraham’s children.

关于基土拉，她在撒拉死后成为亚伯拉罕的妻子并为他生了六个儿子，除此以外，我们所知甚少。第6节以及代上1:32节（“亚伯拉罕的妾基土拉所生的儿子”）表明，她是“妾”，和撒拉相比，社会地位较低。实际上，“妾”是复数，或许暗示基土拉并非唯一给亚伯拉罕生儿育女的妇人。

1. What is the purpose of recording this information about these sons and grandsons of Abraham?

    记录亚伯拉罕子孙的信息有什么目的？

2. How did Abraham show that Isaac was the son of the promise?

    亚伯拉罕如何表明以撒乃是应许的儿子？

3. Why did Abraham send all of his sons away to the land of the east (verse 6)?

    为什么亚伯拉罕要把他所有的儿子打发到东方去（第6节）？

    The New Testament records a sort of “epitaph” of Abraham’s life in several places. Jesus said: “Have you not read what God said to you, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living” (Matthew 22:31–32). And the book of Hebrews, after listing Abraham among the Old Testament believers, says: “All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them” (Hebrews 11:13–16).

    新约在几处记录了某种类似关于亚伯拉罕一生的“墓志铭”。耶稣说：“神在经上向你们所说的，你们没有念过吗？他说，我是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。神不是死人的神，乃是活人的神”（太22:31-32）。希伯来书在记录了保罗亚伯拉罕的旧约信徒之后，说：“这些人都是存着信心死的，并没有得着所应许的，却从远处望见，且欢喜迎接，又承认自己在世上是客旅，是寄居的。说这样话的人，是表明自己要找一个家乡。他们若想念所离开的家乡，还有可以回去的机会。他们却羡慕一个更美的家乡，就是在天上的。所以神被称为他们的神，并不以为耻。因为他已经给他们预备了一座城”（来11:13-16）。

4. The New Testament says that Abraham was “living by faith when he died.” What was Abraham’s faith? What did he believe?

    新约说亚伯拉罕是“存着信心死的”。亚伯拉罕的信心是什么？他相信的是什么？

    It is interesting that Isaac and Ishmael worked together to bury their father in the cave of Machpelah next to his beloved wife Sarah. Perhaps the half-brothers simply worked together for this one task, or perhaps they had been on friendly terms with each other. In either case, they put aside any animosity to show honor to their aged father.

    有意思的是，以撒和以实玛利一起把他们的父亲埋在麦比拉洞里，葬在撒拉旁边。可能俩同父异母的兄弟仅仅在这一事上合作，或者他们向来友好相处。不论如何，他们都把仇恨放到来一边，来尊荣他们年老的父亲。

    Verse 11 tells us that Isaac was living “near Beer Lahai Roi” after Abraham’s death. We are uncertain of the location of this place, but Genesis 16:14 tells us that there was a well there, and it was located between Kadesh and Bered. It is the place where the Lord appeared to Hagar when she fled from Sarah.  

    第11节告诉我们，亚伯拉罕死后，以撒住在“靠近庇耳拉海莱”的地方。我们不知道那里的准确位置，不过创16:14说那里有口井，位于加低斯和巴列中间。那地正是夏甲逃离撒拉的时候，耶和华向夏甲显现的地方。

5. After studying the life of Abraham, what do you think is the main lesson for us from all of these chapters?

    研读了亚伯拉罕的一生，从这些章节当中，你认为我们学到最重要的功课是什么？

    READ GENESIS 25:12-18 创25:12-18

    We were introduced to Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar, in Genesis 16. Already then, we learned that he was half Hebrew and half Egyptian by birth. In Genesis 21:18 we read how God promised to make a great nation of Ishmael. And in Genesis 17:20 w read God’s promise to Ishmael that he would become the father of twelve rulers (chiefs), and this is a record of God’s faithfulness to those promises.

    在创16当中，我们认识了亚伯拉罕和夏甲的儿子以实玛利。那个时候我们知道，他是半希伯来人半埃及人。创21:18当中，我们知道神应许要让以实玛利成为大国。并且在创17:20当中，我们知道神应许以实玛利，他会生十二个族长。该部分正是记录了神对这些应许的信实。

    The record of Ishmael’s descendants is repeated in 1 Chronicles 1:28-31. From the comments in verse 18, it seems that they settled to the south of Canaan, toward the direction of Egypt.

    代上1:28-31再一次记录了以实玛利的后裔。第18节似乎表明，他们住在迦南以南，朝着埃及的方向。

6. We know that Ishmael was not the son of the promise, and not the ancestor of the Messiah, yet the Lord made it clear that he loved Ishmael. What was the evidence that God loved this man also?

    我们知道，以实玛利并非应许之子，他不是弥赛亚的祖先，但是耶和华也明确表示，他爱以实玛利。有什么证据表明神也爱这个人？

    The final verses of this chapter begin the record of the life and family of Isaac which will continue through chapter 35. Because the focus of this course was on the life of Abraham, we will not go into so much detail on these final verses of chapter 25. 

    本章最后几节直到第35章，记录了以撒的一生和家庭。由于本课的中心是亚伯拉罕，对第25章的最后几节，细节我们就不再赘述。

    READ GENESIS 25:19-34 阅读创25：19-34

7. How many years were Isaac and Rebekah married without having any children?

    以撒和利百加婚后多少年都没有子嗣？

8. What truth does Isaac’s prayer on behalf of his barren wife (v. 21) teach us? (see also Psalm 127:3; James 1:17; and Psalm 113:9)

    以撒为不孕的妻子祷告（第21节）对我们有什么教导？（亦见诗127:3；雅1:17；及诗113:9）

9. What prophecy did the Lord communicate to Rebekah when she realized that something special was happening with her pregnancy?

    利百加意识到自己怀孕很特别的时候，耶和华告诉了她什么预言？

10. What is the meaning of the name “Esau”?

    “以扫”的名字是什么意思？

11. What is the meaning of the name “Jacob”?

    “雅各”的名字是什么意思？

12. Verse 31-34 record how Esau despised his birthright. What is a “birthright”? (see Hebrews 12:16 and Deuteronomy 21:17 for help)

    第31-34节记录了以扫如何轻看自己长子的名分。什么是“长子的名分”（来12:16及申21:17可以帮助理解）？

    In the New Testament Esau was strongly criticized for exchanging his birthright for a bowl of stew. Here is what the New Testament says: “See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son. Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. He could bring about no change of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears.” (Hebrews 12:16–17)

    新约强烈批评以扫因为一碗汤而放弃了长子的名分。新约如是说：“恐怕有淫乱的，有贪恋世俗如以扫的。他因一点食物把自己长子的名分卖了。后来想要承受父所祝的福，竟被弃绝，虽然号哭切求，却得不着门路，使他父亲的心意回转，这是你们知道的”（来12:16-17）。

## CONCLUSION 总结

Here is where this course on Genesis 12-25 will end. The main character of these chapters has been Abraham, the founder of the Hebrew nation.

下面是关于创12-25课程的总结。这些章节的主要人物是亚伯拉罕，希伯来民族的开拓者。

In these chapters we observed the following truths that God wants us to remember:

在这些章节当中，我们明白了以下真理，是神希望我们记住的：

1. God is faithful to his promises. Over and over again we read the promises of God to Abraham and saw how God kept every one of them, and in so doing showed that he is able to do the impossible.

    神信守自己的应许。我们一次又一次地看到神对亚伯拉罕的应许，并且也看到了神如何成就每一个应许，并且借着这些表明了他能够做不可能的事。

3. God prepared a nation and place for the day when he would send the Messiah. We saw how God created a new nation (the Hebrew people or the children of Israel) from Abraham and his descendants, and how God began to give him and his descendants the land of Canaan. The Messiah was born into the Hebrew people and lived in the land of Canaan when he came to this earth.

    神为将来要差遣的弥赛亚预备了一个民族和地方。我们看到神如何从亚伯拉罕和他后裔创造了一个新的民族（希伯来人或以色列的子孙），并且把迦南地赐给他和他的后裔。弥赛亚来到世上，正是生在希伯来人中间，住在迦南地。

4. God wants us to believe his words and promises. These chapters reinforced the truth that righteousness comes through faith and not through good works.

    神希望我们相信他的话语和应许。这些章节再次强调了一个真理，就是因信称义，不是因行为称义。

5. All of our blessings come from God, who gives them even though we are undeserving.

    我们一切的祝福都是从神而来，哪怕我们不配得，神仍旧赐给我们。
