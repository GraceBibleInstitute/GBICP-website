## INTRODUCTION 介绍

In chapter 18 Abraham had three visitors. One of them was the Lord himself. The other two were angels, as we discover in chapter 19:1.

在第18章中，亚伯拉罕有三个访客。其中一个是耶和华本人，另外两个是天使，正如我们在第19：1章中发现的那样。

When the angels left Abraham’s tent, they traveled to the city of Sodom. In Genesis 13:13 we were told: “Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD.” In this chapter we find out how deeply their morals had sunk, and the depths of their perversions are revealed.  

天使离开亚伯拉罕的帐篷后，去了所多玛城。在创世纪13：13中说：“所多玛人在耶和华面前罪大恶极。”在这一章中，我们发现他们的道德沦陷得有多深，而且这种沦陷的深度被揭示了出来。

## READ GENESIS 19:1–14 读创世记19:1–14

The apostle who wrote the book of Hebrews may have been referring to this account when he wrote: “Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.” (Hebrews 13:1–2). Lot showed loving hospitality to the two strangers he met at the city gate. However, Lot also showed how life in Sodom had affected his judgment and character.

写希伯来书的使徒在提到下面这句话时说的可能就是这种情况：“不可忘记用爱心接待客旅；因为曾有接待客旅的，不知不觉就接待了天使。”（希伯来书第13章1-2节）。罗得热情接待了他在城门口遇到的两个陌生人。然而，所多玛城的生活方式对他的判断力和性格的影响也同样表现了出来。

1. Why did Lot insist strongly that the two men not spend the night in the city square? See 1 Peter 2:7-8

    罗得为什么强烈坚持说这两个人不能在城市广场上过夜？见彼前2：7-8

2. The depravity and lust of the men of Sodom is shocking. But Lot’s suggestion in verse 8 is also shocking. How could he say such a thing? Why would he make such a terrible offer?

    所多玛人的堕落和贪欲令人震惊，但罗得在第8节中的建议也令人震惊。他怎么能  说出这样的话，提出如此糟糕的提议呢？

The LORD had told Abraham, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.” (Genesis 18:20–21) Now, when we see what happened at Lot’s door, we also see for ourselves the evidence of the sinful condition of Sodom and Gomorrah. The time for God’s judgment against these people has come. There are not even ten righteous people left in Sodom.

耶和华曾经告诉亚伯拉罕说：“所多玛和蛾摩拉的罪恶甚重，声闻于我。我现在要下去，查看他们所行的，果然尽像那达到我耳中的声音一样吗？若是不然，我也必知道。”（创世纪18：20-21）现在，当我们看到在罗得的门口发生的事情时，我们也就亲自看到了所多玛和蛾摩拉罪恶深重的证据。上帝审判这些人的时候已经来了。所多玛甚至连十个义人都没有了。

The two men of Sodom who were engaged to marry Lot’s daughters were given a chance to leave the city and escape the Lord’s judgment. But they treated the warning of impending judgment as a joke. How many times do the people in our own generation also treat the Lord’s warnings and call to leave a life of sin as a joke?

与罗得的两个女儿订了婚的两个所多玛男子被赐予了离开这座城的机会，使他们可以逃避主的审判，但他们却把即将到来的审判警告看成了笑柄。我们这个时代的人也有多少次把主的警告和召唤，把离开有罪的生活看成了玩笑？

But the Lord’s judgment is not a joke. When that day of judgment comes for the world, there will be no more warnings. So now is the time for repentance. Now is the time to believe what the Lord says, turn from sin, and flee to the saving grace of Jesus.

但主的审判不是玩笑。当世界接受审判的日子到来时，将不会再有警告。所以现在就是悔改的时候，现在就是相信耶和华所说的话、脱离罪、逃进耶稣救赎恩典中的时候！

## READ GENESIS 19:15-23 读创世记19：15-23

Lot’s future sons-in-law regarded the warning of judgment as a joke. Now we see that even Lot himself was hesitant to leave the city. Didn’t he understand what was going to happen? The angels had told him plainly: “We are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.” But Lot still hesitated.

罗得未来的女婿们认为，那些审判的警告是一个笑话。现在我们看到，就连罗得自己也在犹豫是否要离开这座城市。难道他不明白会发生什么事吗？天使们已经清楚地告诉了他：“我们要毁灭这地方；因为城内罪恶的声音在耶和华面前甚大，耶和华差我们来，要毁灭这地方。”（创19:13）但罗得迟延不走（第16节）。

3. Why did Lot hesitate to leave (verse 16) when he understood that Sodom would be destroyed?

    罗得明白所多玛要被摧毁了，但为什么还迟延不走？（第16节）？

    In spite of his hesitation to leave, the Lord showed great kindness to him and his family. The Lord would not punish the righteous with the unrighteous. The angels took the hands of Lot, his wife, and his two daughters, and led them out of the city. In spite of their hesitancy to leave, “the Lord was merciful to them.”

    尽管罗得迟延不走，但神对他和他的家人仍然非常仁慈。耶和华不会因为不义的人而惩罚义人。天使们抓住罗得、他妻子和两个女儿的手，把他们从城里拉了出来。尽管他们犹豫着不想离开，但“耶和华怜恤他们。”

4. How has the Lord been merciful to you?

    耶和华神是怎样怜恤你的？

5. Why was Lot afraid to flee to the mountains?

    罗得为什么害怕逃到山上去？

    The small town to which Lot and his family fled was called Zoar, which literally means “tiny town.” The Lord spared that tiny town from the coming destruction only because Lot and his family went there. The location of Zoar is uncertain, but many feel it was location south of the Dead Sea.

    罗得和他的家人逃往的小镇名叫琐珥（Zoar），字面意思是“小的”。主免去对这个小镇的毁灭，只因为罗得和他的家人逃到了那里。琐珥的位置尚不确定，但许多人认为它位于死海以南。

## READ GENESIS 19:24-29 读创世记19：24-29

6. Jesus once spoke about the day that God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. In Luke 17:28-30 Jesus said: “… in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.”

    耶稣曾提到过上帝毁灭所多玛和蛾摩拉的那个日子。在路加福音 17:28-30中，耶 稣说：“…又好像罗得的日子；人又吃又喝，又买又卖，又耕种又盖造。到罗得出 所多玛的那日，就有火与硫磺从天上降下来，把他们全都灭了。人子显现的日子也 要这样。”

7. What day will be like the day that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed?

    将来的什么日子会像所多玛和蛾摩拉被毁灭的日子一样？

T
    he apostle Jude wrote: “Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.” (Jude 6–7) As we read this account, we must understand that it has been written down for us so that we can be prepared ahead of time for the final day of judgment when the city in which we live, along with the entire world in which we live, will be destroyed. Let us live in daily repentance and forsake the sin of this world, putting our trust in Christ alone.

    使徒犹大曾写道：“又如所多玛、蛾摩拉和周围城邑的人，也照他们一味地行淫，随从逆性的情欲，就受永火的刑罚，作为鉴戒。”（犹大6-7）当我们读到这些记述时，我们必须明白，这些事情为我们写下来，是要使我们为末日的审判提前做好准备。我们生活的城市，连同整个世界都将被毁灭。让我们在活着的每一天中悔改，离弃这个世界的罪恶，唯独依靠基督。

8. The Lord had warned Lot’s family that they should not look back when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. Why?

    主曾警告罗得的家人，在所多玛和蛾摩拉被毁灭的时候不要回头看。这是为什么？

9. As part of his teaching about judgment day, Jesus told us to, “Remember Lot’s wife!” (Luke 17:32) What should we remember about her? (see Luke 17:33)

    作为他对审判日的一部分教导，耶稣曾告诉我们：“你们要回想罗得的妻子。”（路加福音17:32）我们应该记住有关她的什么？（见路加福音17：33）

    The apostle Peter wrote down the lesson God wants us to learn from this event. Here is the lesson: “If [the Lord] condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)— if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment.” (2 Peter 2:6–9, NIV84)

    使徒彼得曾写下了上帝希望我们从这个事件中学到的教训。这个教训是：“又判定所多玛、蛾摩拉，将二城倾覆，焚烧成灰，作为后世不敬虔人的鉴戒；只搭救了那常为恶人淫行忧伤的义人罗得。因为那义人住在他们中间，看见听见他们不法的事，他的义心就天天伤痛。主知道搭救敬虔的人脱离试探，把不义的人留在刑罚之下，等候审判的日子。”（彼后2：6-9，NIV84）

    Different theories have been proposed for the “burning sulfur” that turned those cities of the plain to ash. Some have suggested that there was a volcano. However, there is no evidence of lava and other things associated with volcanoes. God did not need to use a naturally occurring event such as a volcano in order to overthrow those cities. It could have simply been a miraculous event of judgment. In any case, a careful search of the area today has not turned up any remains of those cities. They were simply wiped off the face of the earth.

    关于把平原上的城市烧为灰烬的“燃烧的硫磺”有不同的说法。一些人提议说有一座火山。然而，并没有熔岩和其它与火山有关的证据。上帝不需要用火山等自然发生的事件来倾覆那些城市，而可能只是一个奇迹般的审判事件。不管怎样，今天对该地区的仔细搜索还没有发现那些城市的任何遗迹。它们只是从地球上被抹去了。

## READ GENESIS 19:30–38 读创世记19：30-38

After seeing God’s fiery judgment fall on the other cities of the plain, Lot did not feel safe even in the tiny town of Zoar. So he finally left the plain of sin and shame and went where the Lord told him to go – the mountains.

看到上帝的愤怒审判降临到平原的其它城市后，罗得即使待在琐珥那个小镇也没有感到安全。于是他最后离开了充满罪恶和羞耻的平原，去了主叫他去的地方——高山上。

The Dead Sea is in a deep depression in the earth and it surrounded by mountains or high cliffs which contain many caves. (The Dead Sea caves are in that area.) Those cool caves provide shelter from the heat of that dry and hot climate, and so Lot and his daughters took shelter among the caves. We can’t help but observe that Lot, who was once a very wealthy man with great possessions, has now been reduced to living in a cave with just his two daughters (and a good supply of wine). It reminds us of the runaway son in Jesus’ parable (Luke 15) who lost everything when he turned away from his father.

死海位于地球的深洼地，周围是山脉或高悬崖，里面有许多洞穴。(死海洞穴就在那个地区。）这些凉爽的洞穴提供了躲避了干燥炎热气候的庇护所，所以罗得和他的女儿们也躲进了洞穴里。我们不禁注意到，罗得，一个曾经非常富有，拥有大量财富的人，现在却只落得和他的两个女儿（还有大量的酒）住在一个洞穴里。这让我们想起了耶稣寓言（路加15）中的浪子，在他离开父亲之后失去了一切。

10. What was wrong with the plan of Lot’s daughters to have children and preserve the family line?

    罗得的女儿们试图要生孩子并延续家庭血脉的计划有什么错误？

    Verses 37 and 38 make it clear why this disgraceful behavior is recorded in the Bible. Here we learn of the origin of two groups of people – the Moabites and the Ammonites – that will be an important part of the story of God’s people in the future.  

    第37节和38节清楚地说明了这种可耻的行为为什么被记录在圣经中的原因。我们在这里了解到两族人的起源——摩押人和亚扪人，他们将是未来上帝子民故事的重要组成部分。

## MOABITES 摩押人

The Moabite people lived east of the Dead Sea, not far from where Lot and his family once lived. From the time that the Israelites came out of Egypt on their journey to Canaan, until the end of the Old Testament record, the Moabites were enemies of the children of Israel who worshiped idols.

摩押人住在死海以东，离罗得和他的家人曾经居住的地方不远。自从以色列人从埃及出来一路到迦南的时间起，到旧约所记事件的结束，摩押人都是以色列后代的敌人，一直在拜偶像。

However, the Moabites are significant for another reason. Ruth, the great-grandmother of King David, and an ancestor of Jesus, was a Moabite.

然而，摩押人之所以重要的另一个原因还有路得，她是大卫王的曾祖母，是耶稣的祖先，她是一个摩押人。

A search of the Old Testament will reveal frequent references to the Moabites, and in this account of Lot’s daughters we have the record of their origin.  

搜索《旧约》你就会发现，摩押人经常被提到。从这里对罗得女儿的叙述中，我们就知道了他们的起源。

## AMMONITES 亚扪人

The Ammonites also lived east of the Dead Sea, north of the kingdom of Moab. They were also hostile toward the people of Israel from the time of Moses until the time of the great kings of Israel.

亚扪人也住在死海以东，摩押王国的北部。他们从摩西时代到以色列的列王时代，也对以色列人怀有敌意。

Like the Moabites, the Ammonites worshiped idols in horrifying ways that involved human sacrifice. The Lord warned the people of Israel to remain separate from them: “No Ammonite or Moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even down to the tenth generation.” (Deuteronomy 23:3)

与摩押人一样，亚扪人拜偶像的方式极其可怕，包括用活人献祭。耶和华曾警告过以色列人要与他们分开：“亚扪人或是摩押人不可入耶和华的会；他们的子孙，虽过十代，也永不可入耶和华的会。”（申命记23：3）

However, Solomon married both Moabite and Ammonite wives and out of a desire to please them, built worship places for their idols near Jerusalem. Those worship places stood until the God-fearing king Josiah finally destroyed them once and for all: “King Josiah also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption—the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the people of Ammon.” (2 Kings 23:13)

然而，所罗门娶了摩押人和亚扪人的妻子，而且为了取悦她们，在耶路撒冷附近为她们的偶像建造了崇拜场所。这些崇拜的地方一直存留到敬虔的王约西亚最后将它们彻底摧毁：“从前以色列王所罗门在耶路撒冷前、邪僻山右边为西顿人可憎的神亚斯他录、摩押人可憎的神基抹、亚扪人可憎的神米勒公所筑的邱坛，王都污秽了（毁坏或亵渎了）”（王下23：13）

Though the Biblical record will have much to say about the Moabites and Ammonites, this is the last time that we read of Lot. He now disappears from the Biblical record.  

虽然圣经对摩押人和亚扪人还有很多记录，但这是我们最后一次读到罗得。从现在起，圣经对他的记录就停止了。
