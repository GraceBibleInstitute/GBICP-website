**Jesus sends out the Twelve -- Luke 9:1-6; Matthew 10:5-52**

**耶稣差派十二个门徒 -- 路加福音9：1-6   马太福音10：5-52**

It was probably during the early months of A.D. 29 that Jesus made his final preaching trip through Galilee. As he went from village to village preaching and healing, two terrible facts kept troubling his soul.  First, the people were spiritually lost.  Second, the Jewish religious leaders were not giving proper spiritual help and advice to the people.

大约在公元29年前面几个月期间，耶稣行遍加利利，进行最后的传道。耶稣在各乡之间传道、医治的同时，两件可怕的事实一直搅扰他的灵魂。第一，人们灵魂失丧。第二，犹太教领袖无法给出正确的圣灵的帮助和建议。

Jesus’ love and concern now caused him to act. He called the disciples together and then sent them to preach to the people. However, before sending them out he gave them a set of guidelines to use throughout their ministries (Matthew 10:5-52). His instructions were as follows:

耶稣的爱和关注如促使他要行出来。他把门徒召集到一起，然后差派他们去传道。然而差派他们之前，耶稣给他们一套指南，这指南贯穿使徒的传道过程（太10:5-52）。他的指导如下：

1. The Target (vv 5-6). Jesus told the disciples to do the work for which he was calling them. At this time they were to preach only to Israelites. Later they would be sent to all people (Acts 1:8).

    目的（5-6节）。耶稣告诉门徒呼召他们乃是为了做工。这时他们只向以色列人传道。以后他们将要被差派到全人类（徒1:8）。

2. The Tools (vv 7-10). The Gospel makes the ministry. The pastor's great tool is the message of God’s love for his people. The miracles were only to be a witness to the preaching of the Word.

    工具（7-10节）。福音构成了传道。牧师最伟大的工具就是上帝爱世人的讯息。而神迹只是传扬神的道的见证。

3. The Method (vv 11-15). Armed with the Word, the disciples were to go in peace, wisdom, and innocence.

    方法（11-15节）。用神的道武装自己，门徒就会平和、智慧、驯良。

4. The Troubles (vv 16-25). The job was not going to be easy. The disciples were warned to be alert and morally blameless. When the forces of Satan worked against them, the Holy Spirit would be with the disciples and work through them. The message of Christ would sometimes divide families.  Unbelievers would accuse the apostles of working with Satan's power, just as they had accused Christ of that.

    困境（16-25节）。为上帝工作并不是件容易的事。耶稣提醒门徒要时刻警醒，也要在在道德上清白。当撒旦的力量攻击他们时，圣灵会与门徒同在并胜过撒旦的权势。基督的使命有时会分离家庭。不信的人会指责门徒是靠着撒旦的力量做工，正如他们指责基督那样。

5. The Triumph (vv 26-40). To help them stand strong against the forces of evil the disciples were to remember that the Almighty God is all-knowing, always present with his people, and always takes care of the people who are doing his work. Jesus himself would someday praise his faithful servants before his Father in heaven. Finally, through their preaching of the Gospel others would come to faith.

    称圣、典范（26-40节）。为了帮助使徒在魔鬼的势力前刚强壮胆，他们一定要记住万能的上帝无所不知，一直与他的子民同在，而且在意人们为他所作的工。耶稣自己在将来的某一天会在天堂他的父面前称赞他的信实的仆人。最终，通过他们传扬的福音，让其他人信上帝。

After Jesus had finished speaking to the disciples he sent them out in pairs. Perhaps they traveled and preached for as long as a month.  We are not told. However, they came back filled with happiness at seeing how God had blessed the preaching of his Word.  

耶稣与门徒讲完这些话就差派他们两两结伴去传福音。他们或许行走、讲道一个月的时间。关于这个时间圣经没有告诉我们。然而，他们返回时充满了幸福，因为他们看到了上帝是如何祝福传讲他的道的。

**John is executed -- Matthew 14:6-12**

**约翰被处死 -- 马太福音14：6-12**

Sometime during March of A.D. 29, while the disciples were still preaching among the people, news of a terrible murder reached Jesus. John the Baptist had been executed by Herod because he had preached against the king’s adultery. Jesus must have been horrified by the ugly details of the story. But Jesus also was full of deep sorrow. The Forerunner’s life and work had been ended. Jesus knew that soon he would lay down his life even for the likes of the sinners who had beheaded John (Mark 9:12-13).

在公元29年3月的某一天，当使徒们仍然在人们中间传道的时候，一件可怕的谋杀的消息传到耶稣那里。施洗约翰已经被希律王处死，因为约翰说教反对希律的淫乱罪行。耶稣一定被这个故事的丑陋的细节所惊骇。但是耶稣也充满了深切的伤痛之感。这个为主预备道路的人的一生和工作已经结束。耶稣知道他很快也会放弃他的生命，甚至是为了那些已经砍了约翰的头的罪人。


**Jesus’ Withdrawals  (Spring 29 to Fall 29 – about 6 months)**

**耶稣的退隐 （公元29年春 到29年秋 - 大约六个月）**

**Jesus’ First Withdrawal**  **耶稣第一次退隐**

Just as John’s imprisonment marked the beginning of Jesus’ Galilean ministry (see Chapter 3) now John’s death marked its end. From this time on Jesus tried to stop his public ministry and teach the disciples in private. We call this his first withdrawal (drawing back from public ministry).  This first effort to escape the crowds took him to the area near to Galilee.

正如约翰被关押标志着耶稣在加利利地区传道的开始（参看第三章），现在约翰的死标志着耶稣在加利利地区的传道结束了。从这时开始，耶稣试着停止公开传道和私下教导门徒。我们称此为耶稣的第一次退出（从公开传道中退出）。第一次努力避开会众，耶稣来到加利利附近的区域。

**Jesus withdraws to grieve John’s death -- Matthew 14:13-14**

**耶稣为悲伤约翰的去世而退隐 -- 马太福音14：13-14**

When the disciples returned from their preaching trip they were full of excitement. Jesus wanted to discuss what they had done and think over John’s death. So he kept away from the crowd.  Together with the disciples he left Capernaum and got on a boat which would take them six miles north to a more deserted area.

当门徒从他们的传道行程中回来时都很兴奋。耶稣想要讨论一下他们都做了什么，还有他们如何看待约翰的死。因此他远离人群。耶稣和门徒一起离开迦百农，上了一艘船，来到向北6里的多沙漠地带。

**Jesus feeds 5,000 -- Luke 9:10-17**

**耶稣喂饱五千人 -- 路加福音9：10-17**

At the same time the crowd on shore determined to see Jesus. They set out on foot toward Bethsaida Julia. Some people ran and were on hand to meet the ship when it put in to shore. They were joined by some of the people going to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover..

与此同时岸上的会众想要见耶稣。他们步行朝着伯赛大、犹利亚前进。有些男人跑起来期望在船靠岸时见到耶稣。有些去耶稣撒冷过逾越节的人也加入进来。

It was clear that Jesus could not be alone with the disciples. Once again, as he had done so often in the past, Jesus disregarded his own feelings. His love moved him to heal the sick. His love compelled him to preach the Kingdom of God to them.

很明显耶稣和门徒在一起并不寂寞。和往常一样，耶稣再次不顾自己的感觉，他的爱转到医治有病的人上面。他的爱促使他向他们传扬神的国度。

As evening approached, the people became hungry. Jesus’ pity caused him to use his power again.  Jesus ordered the people to sit down in groups on the green grass of the hillside. Then Jesus said a prayer over two small fish and five barley rolls. Jesus then divided them into pieces and had his disciples hand them around to the people. In this simple way Christ performed a miracle of great power. 5000 men plus women and children ate their fill, and 12 baskets of pieces were leftover.

天将晚的时候，会众饿了。耶稣的怜悯让他再次使用大能。他吩咐众人有秩序地坐在山坡的草地上。然后他为两条小鱼和五个大麦饼祷告。耶稣把饼和鱼掰开，让门徒分发给众人。基督用这种简单的方式行出了最大的神迹。喂饱了包括男人、妇女和儿童在内共5000人，还剩了12筐的零碎。

**Jesus walks on the water -- Matthew 14:22-36**

**耶稣在水面上行走 -- 马太福音14：22-36**

Jesus’ miracle fed the crowd with bread and fish, but this also gave the crowd some new ideas.  They did not see Jesus as a savior from sin. Instead, they saw him as a free doctor, a person who could give them food, and a king who would drive out the Romans. So now they were prepared to make Jesus their king, by force, if that would be necessary (John 6:15).

耶稣行神迹用饼和鱼喂饱了众人，但这也让他们有了新的想法。他们不把耶稣看做将他们从罪中拯救的救世主。而是把耶稣看做免费治病的医生，可以供给他们实物的人，以及能够逐出罗马人的王。因此，现在他们计划在有必要的情况下，就强制耶稣做他们的王（约6:15）。

Jesus knew their thoughts, and he wanted no part of their plans. Thus he sent away the disciples (who seemed to have been influenced by the crowd's ideas) and ordered them to take a boat to Capernaum. Soon it would be night, so he sent the people away and then went himself to a mountain to pray. Earlier (see Chapter 4) Jesus had spent a night in prayer before selecting his disciples.

耶稣知道他们的想法，不想成为他们计划的一部分。因此他派出门徒（看上去已经收到会众想法的影响），让他们乘船到迦百农去。很快夜晚来临，他让人群散开，自己到山上祷告去了。之前，他在选门徒之前祷告了一整夜。

Now he prayed for strength to teach the people what his true purpose was. While Jesus prayed, the disciples rowed. About 3:00 in the morning he decided to help his followers. For eight hours they had been rowing against the wind and had rowed only two-thirds of a mile. Now Jesus showed his power over the laws of nature. He simply walked across the lake to the boat. At first the disciples thought that Jesus was a ghost. Then, just when he was ready to climb into the boat Peter jumped out and tried to walk on the water to meet Jesus.

现在他祷告神加给他力量，好让他教导人们晓得他来的真正目的。耶稣祷告的时候门徒把船从岸边撑开。大约凌晨三点时，耶稣决定帮助他的门徒。因为门徒已经逆着风航行了8个小时，确只行进了三分之二里的距离。现在耶稣要向自然规律彰显自己的大能了。他直接在水面上行走，走到船那里。开始是门徒以为耶稣是鬼魂。后来正当耶稣准备上船时，彼得跳出来，并试图在水面上走过来见耶稣。

Peter showed that he had the faith of a hero but also the faith of a coward. As long as he looked at Jesus and trusted his Word he made good progress. However, when he became concerned about the wind and waves Peter began to sink. In his great fear he cried out for help.  Jesus reached out and saved him.

在这里彼得显现了他英雄的信念也显现了懦弱的信念。当他看着耶稣，信任耶稣所说的话时，他走在了水面上。然而当彼得开始关注风浪时，就开始下沉。因为极其惧怕，彼得大喊救命。耶稣伸出手救了他。

Once in the boat, Jesus made the water quiet, again showing his control over nature. This miracle washed the spiritual sleep from the disciples’ eyes. Though they had not believed after the feeding of the 5000, they now boldly declared: “Truly you are the Son of God” (Matthew 14:33).

一次在船上，耶稣平静了风浪，再一次显示他对自然的掌控。这个神迹洗清了门徒们灵里浑浊的双眼。虽然经历了喂饱5000人的神迹他们仍未相信，现在他们勇敢地宣告：“你真是神的儿子了。（马太福音14:33）”

**Jesus’ Bread of Life sermon -- John 6:22-71**

**耶稣关于生命之粮的信息 -- 约翰福音6：22-71**

When the morning sun rose over Galilee, the crowd began looking for Jesus. Unable to find him near Bethsaida Julia, they looked near Capernaum. In time they found him there in the synagogue.

当朝阳在加利利升起时，人群们开始寻找耶稣。在伯赛大附近没能找到他，他们又在迦百农附近寻找。最后他们在会堂中找到了他。

Knowing that the crowd was still looking for a king to give them earthly blessings and not for a spiritual Messiah, Jesus preached a most timely sermon. He did speak about bread. He said that in the Old Testament it was God, not Moses, who fed the people manna in the wilderness.  In this way the LORD had prolonged their earthly lives (Exodus 16:1-15). Now Jesus himself, sent from heaven, is the bread which gives eternal life. Those who wanted to be saved must believe in him.

因为知道这群人仍旧在寻找一个能给他们属世祝福的王，而不是一个属灵的弥赛亚，耶稣讲了一篇极为应景的信息。他讲的是关于粮食。他说，在旧约中是上帝而不是摩西，在旷野中赐给人们玛娜。通过这种方式，上帝是他们得以在世生存（出埃及记16:1-15）。现在耶稣自己从天而降，成为赐下永生的粮食。那些要得救赎的人必须相信耶稣。

If one listens carefully to this sermon, he will hear the great ideas of salvation: grace alone, faith alone, Christ alone. Yet the crowd did not like much of what Christ said. They were upset to learn that Jesus would not immediately take care of all their physical needs.

如果一个人认真地听了这次讲道，他会听到救恩最伟大的信息：唯独恩典，唯独信心，唯独基督。然而人们并不十分喜欢耶稣所说的话。因为知道耶稣不会马上照顾他们所有人身体上的需要，他们开始变得烦躁。

After this event Jesus lost much of his popularity. “From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him” (John 6:66).  Seeing this, Jesus asked the twelve disciples if they too wanted to leave him. But Jesus’ walk on the water and the sermon that followed had strengthened the faith in the disciples’ hearts. It was Peter who now made a bold statement of faith, confessing that Jesus was God’s Son and the only source of eternal life.

这事之后耶稣不再那么受欢迎了。“从此他门徒中多有退去的，不再和他同行。”（约翰福音6:66）。看到这些，耶稣就问十二个门徒，是否他们也想离开自己。但是耶稣行走在水面上和他随后的讲道使门徒心里的信更加坚定。还是彼得勇敢地宣告了他的信仰，承认耶稣是上帝的儿子，是唯一得永生的源头。

**Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath -- Luke 6:1-5**

**耶稣是安息日的主 -- 路加福音6：1-5**

Once again, the Pharisees are quick to accuse Jesus of doing wrong.  Eating a few heads of grain from someone’s field was permitted.  (See Deuteronomy 23:25.)  But the Pharisees were accusing Jesus of violating the Sabbath law: Jesus’ disciples were “working” on the day when they were supposed to rest.

法利赛人又一次很快地攻击耶稣做错事。在别人的地里吃几个麦穗是允许的（见申命记23：25）。但是法利赛人指责耶稣违反安息日的法律：耶稣的门徒在他们应该休息的那一天工作。

Once again, Jesus exposes his enemies’ ignorance of the Scripture. Jesus points to the occasion when David had ignored a ceremonial law in order to satisfy his own and his soldier’s hunger (1 Samuel 21:6).

耶稣又一次指出祂的敌人对经文的无知。耶稣指出大卫曾经在他和他的士兵饥饿之时，没有遵守关于仪式的法律（撒母耳记上21：6）。

In addition to this example, Jesus asserted the fact that he, the Son of Man, was here to fulfill the Sabbath law. The Sabbath law provided physical rest for God’s people.  Jesus had arrived to provide a more important rest; spiritual rest. (See Matthew 11:28-30).    

除了这个例子以外，耶稣宣告，人子是来成全安息日的律法。安息日的律法使上帝的子民得享安息。耶稣的到来提供了一个更重要的安息：灵里的安息。

**Jesus heals the man with a shriveled hand -- Luke 6:6-11**

**耶稣医治了一个一只手枯干的人 -- 路加福音6：6-11**

Luke then mentions another time when the Pharisees were watching how Jesus would react to someone’s need for healing on the Sabbath.  It may be the Pharisees had brought the man with the shriveled hand into the synagogue on the Sabbath.  In any case, they were looking for an occasion to accuse Jesus of doing wrong by healing on the Sabbath.

路加福音又提到另一件事，法利赛人看着耶稣在安息日回应一个人需要医治的需要。可能法利赛人在安息日把这个一只手枯干的人带到会堂。他们在找借口指责耶稣在安息日施行医治。

The Pharisees’ logic was loveless.  Jesus did not do what they wanted him to do; Jesus did not ignore the man’s need for healing.  Jesus did the loving thing. The Pharisees grew angry and talked about what they should do to get rid of Jesus.  

法利赛人的逻辑是没有爱的。耶稣没有做他们想要他做的。耶稣没有忽视那个人需要医治的要求。耶稣做了有爱的事。法利赛人愤怒了，他们商议怎样可以除去耶稣。

**Jesus teaches about clean and unclean -- Matthew 15:1-20**

**耶稣教导关于洁净的和不洁净的 -- 马太福音15：1-20**

Jesus’ popularity continued to be a concern for the Jewish rulers in distant Jerusalem. So the Sanhedrin, whose job it was to check the teachings of all preachers, sent men north to check on Jesus. These men accused Jesus’ disciples of doing wrong.

耶稣的受欢迎程度仍旧是远在耶路撒冷的犹太官长们担忧的事情。所以作为监督教师们教导的犹太公会，差派人到北边查看耶稣。这些人指控耶稣的门徒们做错了事情。

Religious Jews always washed their hands before eating. Some Pharisees even went so far as to suggest that not washing hands before eating was as serious a sin as adultery. The disciples did not wash nor did the multitude at the feeding of the 5000.

犹太教徒总是要在饭前洗他们的手。一些法利赛人过于偏激，甚至建议将饭前不洗手与淫乱罪相提并论。门徒们就没有洗手，那吃饱的5000人群同样没有洗。

The Lord Jesus saw that the problem was not really hand washing.  It was the difference between man-made laws and God’s Law. The Scribes and Pharisees considered man-made laws to be of equal importance with God’s Law.  Jesus pointed out that they even used these man-made laws in ways that went against the Ten Commandments.

主耶稣看到真正的问题并不完全是洗不洗手。这是人的律法和上帝律法的区别。文士和法利赛人将人制定的律法和上帝的律法放在同样重要的位置。耶稣指出他们如此地使用律法，甚至已经违反了十条诫命。

By this time a crowd had gathered hoping to hear an argument. Jesus explained that obeying God's Law begins in the heart and is not a matter of just doing outward deeds.

这时，已经聚集了很多想要看热闹的人。耶稣解释说，遵守上帝的律法是从心里开始的，而不只是做表面的工夫。

The disciples, however, were upset that the powerful Pharisees were offended. Jesus explained that his Father would take care of these false teachers later. In the mean time, Jesus repeated that an unclean heart, not dirty hands, make a man a sinner.

然而，门徒们因为强势的法利赛人被冒犯而感到不安。耶稣的回答是，天父稍后会处理那些错误的教师们。同时，耶稣再次提到，不是肮脏的手，而是不洁净的心让一个人变成罪人。

**Jesus’ Second Withdrawal**  **耶稣第二次“撤退”**

After his meeting with the Jews who thought they could earn salvation by obeying the Old Testament laws, Jesus tried to withdraw for a second time. But once again Jesus was not able to be alone.

当与那些认为自己可以通过遵守旧约律法来赚得救恩的犹太人们会面之后，耶稣试图第二次离开人群。但是又一次，他没能一个人独处。

**Jesus heals a Canaanite woman’s daughter -- Matthew 15:21-28**

**耶稣医治迦南妇人的女儿 -- 马太福音15：21-28**

Jesus would have been arrested if he had gone to Judea at this time. So instead he went north and east to the area around the Gentile cities of Tyre and Sidon. Even there his presence soon became known.

倘若耶稣此时前往犹大地的话，他一定已经被捕了。所以耶稣转向东北地区，来到了外邦人的城市推罗和西顿附近。即使是在那里，他的出现很快就众所周知了。

There a Gentile woman came to Jesus and begged him to heal her demon-possessed daughter. But Jesus pretended not to be interested or care about her problem. At last, however, the reason for his unusual behavior became clear. He had let the woman exercise her faith, thus making it stronger. Then Jesus gladly healed her daughter.

那里有一个外邦的妇人来见耶稣，并且祈求他医治自己被鬼附的女儿。但是耶稣佯装对此没有兴趣，对她的问题漠不关心。然而最后，耶稣这不寻常举动的原因变得明朗。他是在操练这位妇女的信心，使其更加强壮。随后耶稣欣然地医治了她的女儿。

In the Gospels there are several stories in which Jesus attracted Gentile followers: the Wise Men who followed his star (Matthew 2:1-12), the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:4-26), the centurion at Capernaum (Matthew 8:5-13), and now the Canaanite woman. Nevertheless, during his earthly stay Jesus spent most of his energy working among the Jews. After going back to heaven, Jesus would attract to himself the Gentiles as well (Luke 2:32; John 12:32).

在福音书中有很多的故事，在这些故事里耶稣吸引来外邦的跟随者们：如跟随“他的星”的博士们（马太福音2:1-12）；井边的撒马利亚妇人（约翰福音4:4-26）；迦百农的百夫长（马太福音8:5-13）；以及现在迦南的妇人。虽然如此，当耶稣在世上的时候，他大部分的经历都倾注在犹太人身上。当回到天上之后，耶稣同样将外邦人引向他自己（路加福音2:32；约翰福音12：32）。
In general, then, the Gospels show the effect of Jesus’ word among the Jews, while the rest of the New Testament shows the power of that word among the Gentiles. Meanwhile, the New Testament as a whole presents Jesus as the only Savior for all mankind.

总之，福音书显示了耶稣话语在犹太人中造成的影响，而在新约的其他部分则显示出这些话语在外邦人中的能量。同时，新约总的来说表明耶稣是全人类唯一的救主。

**Jesus’ Third Withdrawal**  **耶稣第三次“撤退”**

Apparently Jesus stayed for only a short time in the region of Tyre and Sidon. We are not told why he left so soon. Perhaps it was because crowds of curious people were again bothering him. Therefore Jesus withdrew for yet a third time.

显然耶稣只是在推罗和西顿少许的停留。我们不知道他为什么那么快地离开。也许是因为好奇的人群再次地打扰了他。因此耶稣第三次地远离人群。

**Jesus heals a man who was unable to hear and speak -- Mark 7:31-37**

**耶稣医治了一个耳聋舌结的人 -- 马可福音7：31-37**

The exact route of Jesus’ third withdrawal is not given in the Scriptures. The Master and his disciples probably crossed northern Galilee, then went south to the Sea of Galilee. From there they would have gone on to the partly pagan area of Decapolis (east of the Sea of Galilee).  During the days of walking and the nights of camping out under the summer skies, Jesus taught the disciples many things.

经文中没有告诉我们耶稣第三次“撤退”的准确路线。这位夫子和他的门徒们很可能穿过了北加利利地区，然后向南到达加利利海。从那里他们应该经过了低加波利的部分区域（加利利海东侧）。他们白天行走，夜晚露宿在夏日的星空下，耶稣将许多的事情教导给他的门徒们。

The name of Jesus was big news in Decapolis. Therefore, a large crowd soon gathered, including many sick people, and one deaf and dumb man.  Jesus took that man aside, touched his ear with his finger and touched his tongue with saliva from his mouth. At the command “be opened” the man’s ears and mouth were restored to their normal use.

耶稣的名字对于低加波利的人来说是个轰动的事情。所以，人们很快地聚集起来，其中包括很多病患，以及一个又聋又哑的人。耶稣将这个人叫到一边，用手指摸她的眼睛，用唾沫抹他的舌头。然后命令说“开了吧”，这个人的耳朵和嘴就痊愈，恢复正常了。

**Jesus feeds 4,000 -- Mark 8:1-10**

**耶稣喂饱了四千人 -- 马可福音8：1-10**

When the crowd saw that Jesus had healed the man, they began to praise the God of Israel (Matthew 15:31). For the next three days they followed Jesus in the desert. The Lord knew that the heat of the summer sun and the lack of food would soon weaken the people. So he told the people to sit down, gave thanks, and with a few small fish and seven loaves of bread, Jesus fed 4000 men, plus many other women and children. There were seven baskets of leftovers collected after the meal.

当人们看到耶稣医治了那又聋又哑的人之后，他们开始赞美以色列的上帝（马太福音15:31）。接下来的三天里，他们在沙漠中都跟随着耶稣。主知道夏日的炎热和食物的短缺很快会让人们筋疲力尽。所以他让人们坐下，祝谢了，用几条小鱼和七个饼喂饱了4000男人，外加很多的妇女和儿童。饭后收拾剩下的零碎，装满了七个筐子。

Jesus sent the people away after they had eaten. Then, along with the disciples, he got on a boat and set sail for the opposite shore – the area of Magdala (also called Magadan and Dalmanutha).

人们吃饱了后，耶稣打发他们离开。然后他与门徒们一起，找了一条船，动身前往隔海相望的抹大拉地区（也叫做马加丹或大玛努他）。

**Jewish leaders demand a sign from Jesus -- Matthew 16:1-4**

**犹太人的领袖要求耶稣行一个神迹 -- 马太福音16：1-4**

Somehow the Galileans found out that Jesus was returning. As the boat came to shore, there were Pharisees and Sadducees waiting to meet him.

加利利人不知如何知道了耶稣正回来的事。当船到达岸边的时候，法利赛人和撒都该人也在那里等着见耶稣。

Normally the Pharisees and Sadducees were enemies.  But both groups hated Jesus so much that they now were working together. The Pharisees held to every word of the Old Testament and tried to earn salvation by obeying its laws. The Sadducees used the Old Testament as just a general guide and didn't even believe in life after death. Both groups, however, agreed that Jesus was not God’s Son or the Messiah. The two groups of Jewish leaders now commanded Jesus to do a miracle to prove that he was the Messiah. Apparently the feeding of the 4000 was not enough proof for them.

一般来说，法利赛人和撒都该人是宿敌。但是他们都非常的痛恨耶稣，以至于他们现在同仇敌忾。法利赛人持守旧约的每一句话，并且试图通过遵循律法来赚的救恩。撒都该人仅仅把旧约当作一个普通的教导，并且从不相信死后的生命。然而，他们两群人都认同一点，耶稣不是上帝的儿子或者弥赛亚。这两群犹太人的领袖们现在要求耶稣行一个神迹，以证明他是弥赛亚。显然喂饱4000人的神迹作为证据，对他们来说还是不够。

Jesus was astonished at their unbelief. They could read the signs of the weather (red sky in the morning, sailor take warning; red sky at night, sailor’s delight).  But they could not read the signs that Jesus was God (his many miracles in Galilee and his teachings).

耶稣对他们的不信感到震惊。他们通晓天气变化的征兆（早晨天发红，水手们要小心了；晚上天发红，水手们安枕无忧）。但是他们却读不出耶稣是上帝的征兆（他在加利利所行很多的神迹和他的教导）。

Jesus did not immediately follow their demands. Instead, he promised a final sign to show that he was God –  the sign of Jonah. Just like Jonah came back after three days in the whale, Jesus would also rise from the dead.

耶稣没有立即满足他们的要求。反而，他应许了那最后的征兆，以显示他是上帝——约拿的神迹。像鲸鱼腹中的约拿三天之后返回一样，耶稣也将如此死里复活。

**Jesus’ Fourth Withdrawal  耶稣第四次“撤退”**

Jesus’ stay in Galilee was short. After his run in with the Jewish leaders he left Galilee and the cities where he had preached and worked miracles. He headed for Bethsaida Julias, but first he stopped on a mountain in the northern part of Galilee.

耶稣在加利利待了较短的时间。当他与犹太的领袖们狭路相逢之后，耶稣离开了加利利以及那些他讲道和行神迹的城市。他出发前往伯赛大，在此之前，耶稣在加利利海北边的一座山上短暂地停留。

**Jesus warns his disciples against false teaching -- Mark 8:13-21**

**耶稣警告他的门徒防备假教导 -- 马可福音8：13-21**

Jesus and the disciples got on a boat and sailed north. Although his heart was full of sorrow, he still continued to teach his disciples. He warned them not to become legalistic like the Pharisees or to deny Scripture like the Sadducees. He compared their errors to yeast in bread.  And it was a powerful comparison. Just as a little yeast spreads through all the bread dough, any doctrinal error can spread through the whole teaching of salvation. Unfortunately, at this time the disciples missed the point of Jesus' instruction.

耶稣和门徒们上了船向北行驶，尽管他的心中充满了忧伤，他仍旧不断地教导他的学生们。他警告他们不要变成像法利赛人一样的律法主义者，也不要变成像撒都该人一样否认圣经的人。耶稣将他们的错误比喻成面包中的酵母。这是一个强有力的对比。就像是一小点酵让整团面发起来，任何教义的错误可能扩展到所有关于救恩的教导上。不幸的是，此时此刻门徒们并没有抓住耶稣教导的重点。

**Jesus gives sight to a man who is blind at Bethsaida -- Mark 8:22-26**

**耶稣在伯赛大治好了一个瞎子 -- 马可福音8:22-26**

The boat sailed north until the Lord and his followers got off near Bethsaida Julia. Soon a blind man was led to Jesus.  Christ, not wanting to gather a crowd, led the man to a place where they could be more alone. Then Jesus restored the man's sight.

小船一路向北，直到主和他的门徒们在伯赛大附近上岸。很快有人带着一个瞎眼的人来见耶稣。因为不想使人群聚集起来，基督将这人带到一个他们可以独处的地方。然后耶稣使他重现光明。

This time Jesus did not cure the man all at once, but little by little. However, when the man could see clearly, Jesus commanded him to keep silent about the miracle. He did not want another crowd to gather.

这次耶稣并没有一次性地医治，而是一步一步地治愈他， 然而，当这个人可以看清楚时，耶稣命令他对这个神迹保持缄默。因为他不想再次招来大批的人群。
