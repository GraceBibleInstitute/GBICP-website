**Jesus is rejected in Nazareth -- Luke 4:16-30**

**耶稣在拿撒勒被拒绝 -- 路加福音4：16-30**

Perhaps while Jesus was in Cana he received word that John the Baptist had been arrested.  King Herod had imprisoned him at the fortress of Machaerus near the Dead Sea. The forerunner’s task was complete. Now it was time for Jesus to begin his great Galilean ministry.

也许耶稣还在迦拿的时候就听到施洗约翰被捕的消息。希律王把约翰关押子在死海附近的马卡鲁斯城堡里。约翰预备主的道路的任务完成了。现在是耶稣开始他伟大的加利利人传道的时候了。

As Jesus walked toward Nazareth, one thought was on his mind –"a prophet has no honor in his own country.” That proverb was fulfilled on the Sabbath Day when Jesus entered the synagogue in Nazareth. Jesus knew the place well, having worshiped there since he was a child.  Inside, the men sat on one side with the women hidden behind a screen on the other. Near the middle of the room there was a raised area with a speaker's stand and seat. To the south was a painted box (ark) which contained the sacred Scriptures.

当耶稣走向拿撒勒的时候，有一个想法映入脑中——“先知在他的家乡没有荣耀。”这一点在安息日耶稣进入拿撒勒的会堂时应验了。他很了解这个地方，从孩童时代他就在这里敬拜上帝。在会堂里，男人坐在一边，妇人则躲在屏幕后坐在另外一边。在房子中间有一个突起的地方，是讲道的人站和坐的地方。在南边是一只彩色的盒子（约柜），摆放着神圣的经文。

The service opened with a blessing followed by a creed, and then prayers. The leader then moved from the speaker’s stand to the altar and offered a series of prayers for the day. Since Jesus was asked to give the sermon, he was probably asked to conduct this portion of the service as well. After the prayers, one of Aaron’s descendants, if one was present, pronounced the Aaronic blessing (Num. 6:22-26). This ended the liturgy.

敬拜由祝福开始，接下来是宣讲教义，然后祷告。祷告之后司会的人就从讲道人站立的地方走到圣坛，报告这一天的祷告事项。既然耶稣被要求做讲道，那么他可能同样也被要求完成这些仪式内容。祷告结束之后，如果有亚伦的后代在场，那么就宣告亚纶人的祝福（民6:22-26）。以此结束礼拜仪式。

The teaching part of the service began with seven men reading parts of the Law (the first five books of the Old Testament). Next, Jesus walked to the speaker’s stand where he was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled the scroll and read Isaiah 61:1-2. Meanwhile the congregation stood quietly and listened. When the reading was over, Jesus sat in the speaker’s seat and the people also sat down.

教导的部分以7个人读部分律法开始（即旧约的前五章）。接下来耶稣走到布道的位置，接过先知书以赛亚书。他展开书卷，朗读以赛亚书61:1-2。会众则安静站立聆听。读经结束后耶稣坐在讲道人的座位上，会众也坐下。

Jesus explained the good news in his text. He announced that he was the long-awaited Messiah spoken of in those verses. At first the congregation was amazed. But soon the people became angry. It those days the men often openly expressed themselves in the service. Soon there was mumbling. Then the sounds of anger grew louder. The people said that Jesus was just a simple carpenter’s son.  They demanded miracles as proof of his claim. Jesus tried to show the people the error of their ways, but they would not listen.

耶稣在主题中解释好消息（福音）。他宣告自己就是人们一直等待的弥赛亚，正如那些旧约章节中所说到的。刚开始的时候会众大为惊奇，但是很快他们就变得生气了。在那个时代，男人经常在礼拜仪式上公开表达自己的想法。很快会众中开始出现咕哝声。后来生气的声音开始大了。人们说耶稣只不多是一个单纯的木匠的儿子。于是他们就要求耶稣用神迹来证明他所声称的。耶稣试图向会众表明他们这样做是错的，但是会众不愿听从他。

By then the congregation had become a mob. They dragged Jesus from the synagogue and took him to a rocky cliff at the edge of the town.  They wanted to throw him to his death, but his time to die had not yet come. Jesus walked through the midst of the mob and quietly left Nazareth.

那时会众成了乌合之众。他们把耶稣赶出教堂，把他带到城边的一个石崖边。他们想把耶稣扔下去，但是还不到他死的时候。耶稣从会众中间走过，安静地离开了拿撒勒。

**Jesus calls his first disciples -- Matthew 4:18-22   Mark 1:16-20**

**耶稣呼召他的第一批门徒 -- 马太福音4：18-22    马可福音1：16-20**

From Nazareth Jesus then went to Capernaum which now became his home. Capernaum was an ideal base for Jesus’ mission work. It was a very important city in Galilee. Located on the shores of the Sea of Galilee it was home for many fishermen. It was situated along the chief road between the important city of Damascus and the Mediterranean Sea. It was a center for trade, commerce, and communication. The city was so important that it became the center for collecting taxes and a group of Roman soldiers was stationed there. Years later St. Paul followed Jesus’ example and used important cities as centers for his ministry.

耶稣从拿撒勒去了迦百农，就是成为现在他的家的地方。对于耶稣完成使命的事工来说，迦百农是理想的奠基。迦百农是加利利地区非常重要的一座城市。坐落在加利利海边的迦百农是很多渔民的家。沿线是连接大马士革重要城市和地中海的交通要道。是贸易、商业和交通的中心。迦百农如此重要到，以致成为税收的中心，一群罗马士兵驻扎在这里。几年后圣保罗效仿耶稣，同样也把迦百农作为他宣教的中心。

One day, while walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus spotted his friends Peter and Andrew. His message to them was simple, “Come, follow me and I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew 4:19). Earlier, Jesus had called them to be his followers. Now, Jesus was calling them to be his helpers. A little further along the shore he saw James and John and called them as well.

有一天，耶稣走在加利利海的岸边，他发现了朋友彼得和安得烈。耶稣给他们的信息很简单“来，跟从我！我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样”（太4:19）。之前耶稣呼召他们跟从他，现在呼召他们成为助手。过了没多远，在岸边耶稣见到了雅各和约翰，也同样呼召了他们。

**Jesus Makes His Home In Capernaum Luke 4:14-15; 31**

**耶稣以迦百农为家 -- 路加福音4：14-15；31**

**Miracle of the many fish -- Luke 5:1-11**

**打了很多鱼的神迹 -- 路加福音5：1-11**

Soon a crowd had gathered around Jesus. In order to be more easily seen and heard, Jesus climbed into an empty fishing boat and had Peter push it a few feet off from shore. Sitting down, he began to preach the gospel.

很快耶稣身边就聚集了人群。为了能够让大家更容易看到、听到，他爬进一艘空的渔船，让彼得撑开船，稍微离岸。坐下后开始传讲福音。

When the sermon was over, Jesus had Peter go out into deep water and let down the fishing nets. While fishing usually had its best results at night and near the shore, Peter still obeyed. Immediately the nets were filled with fish. Seeing what had happened, Peter’s fishing partners went out in a second boat. The fish filled both boats until they nearly sunk.  Amazed by the miracle, Peter cried out, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man” (Luke 5:8)!

讲道结束之后，他让彼得把船开到水深的地方，下网打渔。尽管通常情况下在夜里和靠近岸边的地方最容易打上鱼来，但彼得还是听从了耶稣。很快网就满了鱼。看到所发生的这一切，彼得的伙伴又开了一艘船来。鱼装满了两艘船，甚至船要沉下去。彼得为这奇迹所震惊，大喊说：“主啊，离开我，我是个罪人”（路5:8）！

This was clearly the wrong way to think. Sinners must seek Jesus’ presence for the forgiveness of sins, not order him to go away.  The proper response is that of the hymn writer Magnus B. Landstad who wrote:

这明显是错误的思考方式。罪人必然会寻找耶稣以获得赦免，而不是让主离开。正常的反应就如赞美诗作家马格努斯B. 兰德斯泰德所写的：

> When sinners see their lost condition
> And feel the pressing load of sin, 
> And Jesus comes upon his mission
> To heal the sin-sick heart within, 
> All grief must flee before his grace
> And joy divine will take its place.

> 罪人迷失时
> 倍感罪的压力
> 耶稣要完成他的使命
> 医治因罪受伤的心灵
> 在他的恩典中所有的罪得释放
> 来自属天的喜乐代替所有悲伤

But Jesus did not get angry with Peter.  He simply stated, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will catch men” (Luke 5:10).

但耶稣没有生彼得的气。他简单地说道：“不要怕，从今以后，你要得人了”（路5:10）

So we have studied three miracles of Jesus: changing water into wine at Cana, healing the nobleman’s son, and now catching a full boat of fish. Later, in one day alone, he cast a demon from a man who had entered the synagogue in Capernaum, healed Peter’s mother-in-law, and that evening healed many and cast out many demons (Mark 1:21-34).

到此我们已经学习了耶稣的三个神迹：在迦拿把水变成酒，医治大臣的儿子，打满一船的鱼。后来，在一天里，耶稣在迦百农的会堂里从一个男人身上赶走了鬼，医治彼得岳母的，在那天晚上医治了很多人，赶出很多鬼（可1:21-34）

**Jesus in Capernaum’s Synagogue -- Mark 1:21-28**

**耶稣在迦百农的会堂 -- 马可福音1：21-28**

This took place on a Sabbath. Jesus performed this wonderful work of driving out a demon on the day of rest.  This man received both spiritual rest and physical rest on the same day.

这事发生在一个安息日。在安息的日子，耶稣行了一个奇妙的神迹 - 赶出了一个污鬼，使被鬼附的人得到了灵里和肉体上的安息。

**Jesus heals Peter’s mother-in-law -- Mark 1:29-34**

**耶稣医治彼得的岳母 -- 马可福音1：29-34**

Notice that Jesus did not work miracles to win the favor of the people. Sometimes he did his mighty works of love simply to help someone in need.  At other times his wonders showed that he was God and the promised Messiah. But most of his miracles did both of these at the same time. For example, at the wedding in Cana he kept a young couple from being embarrassed. Yet, by doing this, he proved that he was the Son of God.

我们注意到耶稣并没通过行神迹去赢得人们的喜欢。有时候他只是出于爱而帮助有需要的人。而在另外一些时候，他的神迹表明了他就是上帝，就是将来的弥赛亚。但他所行的大多数神迹则同时具有这两个特点。比如，在迦拿的婚礼上，他让一对年轻夫妇脱离窘境。然而，通过神迹他证明了自己就是上帝的儿子。

We should also note that Jesus never did miracles in anger. In Old Testament times prophets frequently did mighty works showing God’s anger towards sinful men (Numbers 16:31; 2 Kings 1:10-12). Jesus, on the other hand, was against this (Luke 9:54-56). He performed only signs of grace and mercy.

我们也应该注意到耶稣永远都不在怒气中行神迹。在旧约时代，先知经常行神迹，鲜明上帝对罪恶的人类的怒气（民16:31；列下1:10-12）。另一方面，耶稣反对这样做（路9:54-56）。他只代表恩典和怜悯。

**Jesus Travels Through Galilee Preaching The Gospel -- Mark 1:35-39**

**耶稣在整个加利利布道 -- 马可福音1：35-39**

After spending a few days in Capernaum Jesus decided to take his ministry throughout Galilee. Perhaps Jesus thought that the people of Capernaum needed some time to think about all they had seen and heard. Meanwhile he would go from town to town preaching the gospel. Jesus did not arrive at this decision easily. It came only after hours of quiet prayer (Mark 1:35). As we have seen, the Lord always prayed before making major decisions.

在迦百农待了几天后，耶稣决定要在整个加利利传道。他认为迦百农的人们需要一段时间思想所看到的和听到的。同时，他要从一个城市到另一个城市去传讲福音。耶稣并不是轻易地做了这个决定。而是静静地祷告了几个小时后的结果（可1:35）。正如我们所看到的，我们的主在做重大决定之前总是要祷告。

Jesus preached and performed miracles throughout Galilee. His acts of mercy, however, could at times cause problems for his teaching. One example can be seen in the story of a leper.

耶稣在整个加利利布道、行神迹。然而他的怜悯有时也给布道带来麻烦。在有关麻风病人的故事中我们能找到一个例子。

**Jesus heals a man of his leprosy -- Mark 1:40-45**

**耶稣医治长大麻风的人 -- 马可福音1：40-45**

Leprosy was a very terrible disease.  People with leprosy were considered the living dead. Leprosy first attacked the skin, leaving sores and raised lumps.  Then, leprosy attacked the soft parts of the mouth and throat. Finally, as the disease got worse, the victim’s hair would fall out.  His nose and lips would be eaten away, and his bones and joints would begin to rot.

麻风是一种非常恐怖的疾病。得了麻风病的人被认为是活着的死人。麻风病首先会侵袭皮肤，非常痛而且有凸起的肿块。然后会进一步侵袭嘴和喉咙的软组织部分。最终，病情恶化，病人的头发会脱落。鼻子和嘴唇也会被腐蚀掉，骨头和关节开始腐烂。

One day as Jesus was walking along, a man “covered with leprosy” suddenly came up to him. Jesus reached out and touched him, and immediately the disease disappeared. Christ sent the man to the priest to be declared clean.  But first Jesus ordered the man not to tell anyone what had happened. Jesus did not want people to think only about the miracles he did.  Jesus wanted the people to think more about the message he was preaching. But what Jesus had feared took place. The man talked freely.  As a result, crowds of sick and curious people gathered in every city where Jesus went. “As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere” (Mark 1:45).

一天耶稣正走着的时候，一个“得了大麻风”的人突然来到他面前。耶稣伸出手摸他，这病立即消失了。基督让这个人去找大祭司并给他看。耶稣确首先要他不要跟别人讲这件事。耶稣不想让人们仅仅想到他所行得神迹。他想要他们更多地思想他所传道的信息。但耶稣害怕的事情发生了。这个被医治的人倒说了很多。结果是耶稣每到一个城市，都聚集了生病的和好奇的人们。“叫耶稣以后不得再明明地进程，只好在外边旷野地方。人从各处都就了他来”（可1:45）。

**MORE SABBATH CONTROVERSIES**

**更多的关于安息日的争论**
						
**The disciples harvest heads of grain -- Luke 6:1-5**

**门徒掐麦穗 -- 路加福音6：1-5**

Jesus and his disciples were travelling through the countryside. As they walked along some Pharisees joined them. They were looking for any excuse to condemn Jesus. Their opportunity came on another Sabbath day.

耶稣和门徒从乡下经过。沿途中一些法利赛人加入进来，想要找借口谴责耶稣。在另外一个安息日，他们的机会来了。

That day Jesus’ disciples walked through a wheat field, picking some grain, separating the seed and eating it. The Pharisees did not accuse the disciples of stealing. They were merely satisfying their need for food, something allowed by Mosaic Law (Deuteronomy 23:25). However, the disciples were accused of working on the Sabbath (reaping and threshing).  The Pharisees held Jesus responsible for their actions.

这一天耶稣的门徒走过一片麦地，拾取了一些麦穗，剥开吃了。法利赛人不指责门徒偷盗。他们只是满足一下对事物的需要，这是摩西律法所允许的（申23:25）。然而，门徒被指责的是在安息日做工（收割和打谷）。法利赛人认为耶稣应该为他们的行动负责。

When confronted by the Pharisees, Jesus gave a sharp reply. First, he directed them to an example set by King David. David had once eaten the bread in the Lord’s tabernacle, even though this was not proper. Nevertheless, the need of the moment was more important, so no one ever condemned David (1 Samuel 21:1-6). In Jesus’ case it was not just a case of need being more important than following man-made laws. Jesus was the “Lord of the Sabbath” (Luke 6:5). Because he was God’s Son, Jesus had the right as God to do away with Old Testament rules.

在与法利赛人对质时，耶稣给出了一个犀利的答复。首先，耶稣讲了一个大卫王的例子。大卫曾经吃了主帐幕里的面包，虽然这是不合适的。然而，那一刻的需求更重要，因此没有人指责大卫（撒上21:1-6）。在耶稣的这个事例中，这并仅仅是需求比遵行人制定的律法更重要的问题。耶稣是“安息日的主”（路6:5）。因为他是上帝的儿子，他和上帝一样有权利废除旧约的律法。

**Jesus heals a man in the synagogue -- Luke 6:6-11**

**耶稣在会堂医治了一个人 -- 路加福音6：6-11**

The third dispute took place on another Sabbath day. This time Jesus was teaching in a synagogue. The Scribes and Pharisees tried to trap Jesus. There was a man present with a withered right hand. Would Jesus heal him on the Sabbath day? The rules of the Pharisees kept a doctor from helping anyone on the Sabbath unless it was a matter of life and death.

第三次争论发生在另外一个安息日。这次耶稣正在会堂里教训人。文士和法利赛人这次想要设陷阱诱导耶稣。在会堂里有一个人的右手枯干了。在安息日耶稣会医治他妈？在安息日，除非是生死攸关的事儿，否则法利赛人的律法不让医生医治任何人。

Jesus, knowing their hearts, reminded them that if a man’s sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath he would save the animal. Then, turning to the Pharisees and Scribes, he asked this question, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” (Mark 3:4). They said nothing. What Jesus meant was obvious. While the Lord said that some things should not be done on the Sabbath, he had not forbidden every action. God never intended to keep people from doing good deeds.  But the idea of mercy never entered the minds of these religious leaders.

耶稣知道他们的心思，提醒他们说，如果一只羊在安息日掉进坑里，主人一定会救羊的。然后，耶稣转向法利赛人和文士，问他们说：“在安息日行善行恶，救命害命，哪样是可以的呢？”（可3:4）。他们都不做声。耶稣的意思是明显的。主说在安息日有些事不可做时，他并没有禁止每一件事。上帝永远不会故意阻止人们好的行为。但是怜悯的意念无法进入到这些宗教领袖的里面。

Without waiting, Jesus healed the man. Immediately the men who had argued with Jesus became his worst enemies. Because they hated Jesus, they began to make plans against him with their other enemies. Before this, the patriotic and nationalistic Pharisees hated the Herodians. The Herodians were willing to cooperate with the Romans; they now joined together and made plans to murder Jesus, a man of mercy. (Mark 3:6)

所以没有等耶稣治愈手枯干的人。与耶稣争论的那人立刻就成了他最大的敌人。因为他们憎恨耶稣，他们开始和其他敌对耶稣的人计划如何反对他。此前，那些爱国也好不爱国也好的法利赛人憎恨那些效忠希律一世的人。希律一世愿意与罗马人合作。然而，现在他们结合到一起，计划杀掉耶稣，这个有怜悯的人。(MARK 3:6)

This angry reaction against Jesus is not too surprising. After all, they thought that Jesus was threatening their religion. The Pharisees taught that man can save himself. Jesus, on the other hand, taught that man cannot save himself but that salvation is a gift of God through himself, the Son of God.

这种反对耶稣的怒气反应并不足为奇。毕竟他们认为耶稣正威胁着他们的宗教信仰。法利赛人教导人们自己拯救自己。而耶耶稣的教导是：人不能自救，救赎是上帝通过耶稣、上帝的儿子给人的礼物。

**Mission work in Galilee -- Matthew 12:15-21**

**在加利利的事工 -- 马太福音12：15-21**

Although Jesus was now hated by the Jewish religious leaders, he was more popular than ever with the common people. Jesus and the disciples went again to the Sea of Galilee. Many people from Judea, Idumaea, Galilee and the area of Tyre and Sidon came in crowds to see Jesus with their own eyes and to have him heal their diseases.

现在虽然基督被犹太教领袖所憎恨，但在平民当中他比以前更受欢迎了。耶稣和门徒再次来到加利利海。很多人从犹大、以东、加利利以及推罗和西顿一代，来到加利利要亲眼看到耶稣，让耶稣医治他们的病痛。

Jesus was filled with mercy.  He did heal the sick and throw out demons. As the evil spirits left their victims they called Jesus the “Son of God,” the Messiah (Mark 3:11). But Jesus ordered them to be silent. The Savior wanted to be acknowledged by men, not by defeated and scared demons. And many in the crowd did believe in Jesus. They found him to be the one spoken of in Isaiah (42:14).

耶稣充满怜悯。他医治有病的人，赶出魔鬼。在邪灵离开被附的人时，他们称耶稣为“神的儿子”，弥赛亚（可3:11）。但耶稣吩咐他们不要声张。救世主想想要被人熟知，而不是被击败和慌张的魔鬼所熟知。会众中人多人信了耶稣。他们发现耶稣就是以赛亚书中所说的那人（42:14）。

Before we leave this part of Christ’s life, one other question must be answered. Why did the people continue to rush to Jesus even after he had been totally rejected by their religious leaders? The answer is quite simple. While religious leaders saw Jesus as a rival, some of the people believed Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah. Others saw him as a political savior, a messenger from God who would heal their diseases, give them all they needed for their daily life, and, in time, throw out the hated Romans.

在我们结束耶稣这段生活之前，必须要解决另外一个问题。为什么人们不断地涌向耶稣面前，即使是在他已经完全被宗教领袖们排斥之后？答案很简单。虽然宗教领袖看耶稣为异己，还是有些人相信耶稣所宣告的——弥赛亚。其余的人则把耶稣看为争夺权力的救主，从上帝而来的信徒、医治他们的疾病，供给他们日常生活的所需，同时也抵制他们所憎恨的罗马人。

## APPENDIX:  MIRACLES 附录：异能

People living in any age were and still are skeptical of unnatural events or actions.  We {together with the Bible} call these things miracles (wonders; signs). 

任何时代的人都会对超自然的事件和行为存有怀疑。我们（和圣经一起）把这些事叫做异能（奇事；神迹）

Moses needed something to convince the people that the LORD had sent him. The LORD enabled Moses to do miracles to prove his claims to be from the LORD God.  The miracles convinced the people.  

摩西需要说服人们上帝派他来的。主使摩西可以行异能来证明他是神派来的。异能使人信服。

Miracles are part of God’s Word (revelation) through which God converts people.  There were three ages (eras) of miracles:  

异能是上帝的话语（启示）的一部分。通过异能，上帝使人成为他的子民。异能存在于三个时代：

Moses			The LORD started using prophets at Moses’ time

摩西			在摩西时代上帝开始使用先知

Elijah/Elisha		Prophets needed a defense of their preaching

以利亚/以利沙	先知需要为他们的布道辩护

Jesus/apostles		Jesus needed to persuade his disciples (John 14:11)

耶稣/使徒		耶稣需要说服门徒（约翰福音14：11）
	
We believe the miracles reported in the Bible. We believe the testimony to these miracles because God the Holy Spirit is at work in this testimony.  An unbeliever refuses to see the LORD at work even if the unbeliever sees the miracle happen.

我们相信圣经中记录的异能。因为圣灵在这些异能的见证中工作，我们相信关于这些异能的见证。

## Review of Chapter 4 第4章回顾

1.	Simon, Andrew, James and John all left everything – at once – when Jesus said “Come, follow me”. Why is this surprising and NOT surprising at the same time?

    当耶稣说“来，跟着我”时，西蒙，安德鲁，詹姆斯和约翰都立即离开了所有东西。为什么这个令人惊讶并且同时并不令人惊讶？

2.	Mark’s Gospel has been called the Gospel of Peter.  John Mark (his more complete name) was a companion of Peter in mission work.  Peter was there when Jesus gave a deaf man his hearing with the word “Ephphatha” (Mark 7:34).  Mark records the word Peter heard.  Peter was there when Jesus raised Jairus’ daughter with the words “Talitha Koum” (Mark 5:41).  The angel’s words to the women: “Tell his disciples and Peter” (Mark 16:7) are found only in Mark.  What evidence is there in Mark 1:29-34 that this healing of Peter’s mother-in-law is told from the perspective of Peter and his family?

    马可的福音书被称为彼得的福音书。约翰-马可（他更完整的名字）是彼得在福音事工中的伴侣。当耶稣用“以法大”这个词打开了一个聋子的听力时（马可福音7:34），彼得在场，马可记录了彼得听到的话。当耶稣用“大利大古米”（马可福音5:41）复活睚鲁的女儿时，彼得也在场。天使对女人的话：“告诉他的门徒和彼得”（马可福音16：7）也只在马可福音中能找到。在马可福音1：29-34 中有什么证据表明彼得岳母被治愈是从彼得和他的家人的角度来讲述的？

3.	Read Colossians 2:16-17. Explain how the Sabbath was a picture of Christ.

    阅读歌罗西书2：16-17。解释安息日如何预表基督。

4.	How many of Jesus’ miracles are mentioned in the Gospel of Mark?

    马可福音中提到了多少耶稣行的神迹？

5.	Can you think of any miracle, done by Jesus, which was not of the gospel, but of the law? (See the Appendix – the last comparison.)

    你能想到耶稣所行的任何奇迹中有不是福音，而是律法的吗？ （见附录 - 最后的比较。）
