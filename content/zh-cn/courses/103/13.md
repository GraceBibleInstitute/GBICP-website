## Jesus is betrayed and arrested in Gethsemane -- Luke 22:47-53   John 18:1-11

    耶稣在客西马尼园被出卖并被捕 -- 路加福音22：47-53    约翰福音18：1-11

Jesus suffered mental and spiritual grief in the garden.  Soon his physical struggle and suffering would begin.  Judas entered the garden leading a group of Roman soldiers armed with swords and Jewish religious leaders and temple guards carrying clubs.  Judas showed which man the soldiers should arrest by going up to the Son of God and kissing him. This was the worst act of betrayal in human history.

在客西马尼园中耶稣经历了心灵的苦痛。不久之后，等待他的将是身体上的折磨和痛苦。犹大来到园中，一队佩剑的罗马士兵、犹太宗教领袖和手持棍棒的差役跟在他的后面。犹大通过亲吻耶稣，向士兵们示意他就是他们要上前逮捕的耶稣，上帝的独生子。这就是人类历史上最令人不耻的背叛。

Jesus did not normally use his divine power while on earth except to heal or help people. This time, however, his power threw the mob to the ground.  Then Jesus surrendered himself.  In this was he indicated that he was willing to be arrested and suffer.  But the disciples did not understand what Jesus was doing. Peter grabbed his sword and struck one of the soldiers, cutting off the man’s ear.  Jesus healed the man’s ear, again showing that he was peacefully going with the arresting soldiers and did not want to cause a bloody fight.

除了曾用神圣的能力医治和帮助人们外，在世上耶稣没有理所当然地使用它们。然而这一次耶稣用这样的能力，让前来抓捕他的人们倒退着倒在了地上。随后他就放弃了抵抗。这些都表明他是自愿被捕、承受痛苦的。但是他的门徒们无法理解耶稣所做的一切。彼得拿着他的匕首攻击了其中的一个士兵，并切掉了他的耳朵。耶稣随后治愈了士兵的耳朵，再一次显示出他想要跟着捉拿他的士兵平静地离开，而不希望看到一场血战。

After Jesus was arrested, the disciples, along with an unnamed young man, fled. Since the latter is mentioned only in Mark’s Gospel account, it is thought that this man was Mark.

耶稣被捕后，他的门徒们和一个不知名的年轻人都逃跑了。因为这个细节只被记录在路加福音中，因此猜测这个年轻人可能就是马可。

Before beginning a study of Jesus’ trials before the religious leaders, we should remember that several times earlier he had prophesied about the events that would now happen.

在了解耶稣被宗教领袖审判之前，我们应回忆起，此前他曾多次预言到即将发生的这些事情。

If we put all six of these prophecies together it would read like this:

如果我们把所有这六次预言放在一起读，我们将会看到这些：

Destroy the temple of my body and I will raise it again in three days. But before this I must go to Jerusalem and be betrayed into the hands of men. You disciples will be scattered. I must suffer many things at the hands of the Jewish religious leaders. They will condemn me to death and turn me over to the Gentiles.  They will mock, spit on, beat, and crucify me.  On the third day I will be raised to life.

毁掉我身体的殿，我将会三天内再建起来。但是在这之前，我必须去耶路撒冷，被交在人的手里。你们作为我的门徒，将要四散而逃。我必须在犹太宗教领袖那里忍受许多的苦。他们要定我的死罪并会把我交在外邦人手中。他们会嘲弄我，用吐沫吐我，打我，将我钉在十字架上。在第三天我会死而复活。

## Jesus is placed on trial by the Jewish religious leaders

    耶稣被犹太宗教领袖审问

### Jesus is brought first to Annas -- John 18:12-14; 19-24

    耶稣首先被带到亚那面前 -- 约翰福音18：12-14；19-24

Annas was the high priest whom the Jews recognized as their high priest.  It was in the trial before Annas that “evidence” was gathered against Jesus.  Annas, however, was not recognized by the Romans.  Caiaphas, Annas’ son-in-law, had the respect of the Romans.  A trial before Caiaphas was necessary for the Romans to take notice.

亚那是犹太人认可的大祭司。亚那的审讯中收集了对耶稣不利的“证据”。但是亚那不被罗马人认可。而亚那的女婿该亚法被罗马人尊重。所以要得到罗马人的接受必须到该亚法面前去审判耶稣。

### Peter denies Jesus -- Luke 22:55-62

    彼得否认耶稣 -- 路加福音22：55-62

While Jesus was being tried by the religious leaders, in a near-by courtyard Peter was also on trial. People there were accusing him of being a disciple of Jesus. Three times he pleaded not guilty.  When the rooster crowed for the second time Peter remembered Jesus’ earlier warning, “before the rooster crows twice you yourself will deny me three times.” Then he broke down and wept (Mark 14:30,72).

当耶稣正在被宗教领袖审问时，在附近的一个园子里，彼得同样经受着试炼。在那里的人们指认他是耶稣的一个门徒。他三次否认了他们的指控。当鸡叫第二次的时候，彼得想起来耶稣早些时候曾警告他说：“鸡叫两遍以先，你要三次不认我。（马可福音14:30,72）”想到这些，彼得忍不住哭了。

### Jesus is convicted of blasphemy by Caiaphas  -- Luke 22:63-71

    耶稣被该亚法判为亵渎上帝 -- 路加福音22：63-71  

Jesus was then taken to the house of the high priest, Caiaphas. Soon some members of the Jewish council (Sanhedrin) gathered to judge him. As he had prophesied, Jesus suffered many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the Law. He was blindfolded, hit, and spit on.  Then this court condemned him to death. His crime was claiming to be the Son of God.  Since his claim was true, there was really no crime at all.

耶稣被捕后被带到了大祭司该亚法的家中。没多久，一些犹太议会（公会）的成员聚集在那里开始审问他。就像他曾预言的，耶稣在长老，祭司长，文士们的手下受了很多苦。他们蒙上他的眼睛打他，朝他身上吐口水。随后这个裁判庭认定他该受死罪。他的罪行是宣称自己是上帝的儿子。因为他宣称的是事实，他显然是清白的。

When Jesus said that he was the Christ, he added, “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven” (Mark 14:62).  What did Jesus mean? For the moment these religious leaders were his judges, but one day he would be their Judge.  They might kill his earthy body, but he would one day decide where these leaders would spend eternity.

当耶稣说他就是基督时，他补充说：“你们必看见人子，坐在那权能者的右边，驾着天上的云降临（马可福音14:62）”。耶稣说的是什么意思呢？在那个时刻，这些宗教的领袖可以审判耶稣，但是有一天他们将要被耶稣审判。他们可以杀死耶稣在世上的身体，但是有一天耶稣将是决定这些人在哪里度过他们来生的那个人。

Since the Jewish council could not legally conduct business at night, they met again at daybreak to confirm the decision of their secret night meeting. They condemned Christ. He was guilty of blasphemy, a crime with the penalty of death. However, while the Roman government allowed the Jews to punish small crimes themselves, they were not permitted to put anyone to death. Only a Roman court could execute someone. Thus, according to Jesus' prophecy, the Jews turned him over to the Gentile Romans.

犹太议会在夜里商议事情是非法的，因此他们在破晓的时候再次聚在一起，明确了他们在夜里秘密商议的决定。他们定了耶稣的罪。耶稣亵渎了神明，罪当处死。然而，因为罗马政府允许犹太人自己惩罚轻微的犯罪行为，却不允许他们处死任何人。只有罗马法庭才能执行死刑。因此，如耶稣所预言的一样，犹太人讲耶稣交到了罗马人这些异教徒手中。

### Judas hangs himself -- Matthew 27:3-10

    犹大上吊自杀 -- 马太福音27：3-10

The tragic case of Judas Iscariot is a good reminder that where sin remains unforgiven, man has no inner peace. In spite of the 30 silver coins in his purse, the weight of God’s Law (Deuteronomy 27:25) pressed down heavily on him. Even confessing his wrong and returning the money could not bring him peace. He now decided on suicide.

加略人犹大的悲剧提醒我们，一个人若得不到罪的赦免，他永远得不到内心的平安。尽管三十块钱已经到手，但是上帝的律法使他不堪重负。甚至他忏悔了自己的过错，并将所得的钱如数退还，但这仍旧不能使他得到平安。最后，他选择了自杀

Meanwhile, there was another man filled with sorrow because of his sins.  He was Peter, the one who had denied the Savior three times. It is interesting to see how Peter found the inner peace which Judas wanted so much. But that story will have to wait until the next chapter.

期间，还有另一个人的内心因为罪而充满了愧疚。他就是彼得，三次不认主的彼得。有意思的是，我们可以看到彼得是如何得到犹大无比渴慕的内心平安的。这个故事会在下一个章节中谈到。

## Jesus is placed on trial by the Gentiles

    耶稣受外邦人的审判

### Pilate -- Luke 23:1-5

    彼拉多 -- 路加福音23：1-5

The Jews condemned Jesus for religious reasons. When they brought him before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, they changed their charges. Since Pilate would not be interested in religious issues, Jesus was charged with political crimes.

犹太人因为宗教的理由定了耶稣的罪。当他们把耶稣带到罗马官员本丢彼拉多面前时，他们改变了之前的指控。因为彼拉多并不关心宗教问题，所以耶稣被指控犯有政治罪。

During the course of the trial, just as he predicted, Jesus was mocked, spit on, flogged and [as we will see shortly] crucified by the Gentiles.  The Jewish guards had mocked and beaten Jesus because he was the Messiah. The Roman soldiers did the same to Jesus because he was a king.

就像耶稣曾预示的一样，在他经受审讯的同时，他被嘲笑，人们吐口水在他身上，他被鞭打，并且（我们将要马上谈到）被异教徒钉在十字架上。犹太守卫因为他自称是弥赛亚而嘲弄击打他。罗马兵丁们也因为耶稣自称是犹太人的王做了同样的事。

### Herod -- Luke 23:6-11

    希律 -- 路加福音23：6-11

Pilate, in spite of all his failings, was not easy to fool. He could see that Jesus was innocent and that the Jews were jealous of him.  So he tried to refer the case to King Herod.  

尽管彼拉多曾经有很多的失败，但是却不是那么容易被愚弄。他知道耶稣是无罪的，他也看出犹太人嫉妒他。所以彼拉多曾尝试将这个烫手的山芋教给希律王。

Herod did not accomplish anything except to ridicule and make fun of Jesus.  Then Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate.  

希律除了藐视和戏弄耶稣之外，没有做什么事。然后希律把耶稣送回给了彼拉多。

### Pilate – a second time -- Luke 23:12-25

彼拉多 – 第二次 -- 路加福音 23：12-25

Luke tells us that on this day Pilate and Herod became friends.  Herod and Pilate had been arguing over political matters.  But they had agreed that Jesus was a nuisance.  By their “friendship” these Jewish and Gentile leaders fulfilled prophecy.  See Psalm 2:1-3.  Also read Acts 4:25-27.

路加福音告诉我们，在那一天彼拉多和希律就成了朋友。希律和彼拉多曾经就政治问题争论过。但是他们都同意耶稣是一个麻烦。因为他们的“友谊”，犹太人和外邦人的领袖们成就了预言。参见诗篇2：1-3。另参见使徒行传4：25-27.

Pilate had Jesus beaten, hoping that the Jews would pity him. When that failed, he threatened to release a violent criminal named Barabbas. But the Jews would not take “no” for an answer. They got their way by threats. While Pilate was washing his hands of the whole matter the Jews cried out, “Let his blood be on us and on our children” (Matt. 27:24-25).

随后他毒打了耶稣，希望借此能够使犹太人有些恻隐之心。当这些都失败后，他威胁要释放一个叫巴拉巴的暴徒。但是犹太人没有否定这个提议。他们得到了想要的，也为此付出了代价。当彼拉多为这所发生的一切在众人面前洗手，表明他与此无关时，犹太人门喊着：“他的血归到我们和我们的子孙身上。”（马太福音27:25）

John’s Gospel (especially chapters 18 and 19) includes more of the conversations between Pilate and Jesus.  For a while it seems that Pilate was being convinced that Jesus should be released.  But Pilate’s personal concern about his own future was more important to him. So Pilate yielded to the demands of the people; Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified.  

约翰的福音书(特别是第18章和第19章)包含了更多彼拉多和耶稣之间的对话。有一段时间，彼拉多似乎被说服，认为耶稣应该被释放。但彼拉多个人对自己未来的担忧对他来说更重要。于是彼拉多顺应百姓的要求，把耶稣钉在十字架上。

## The crucifixion of Jesus

耶稣的被钉十字架

According to Matthew -- Matthew 27:32-44

根据马太 -- 马太福音27：32-44

According to Mark -- Mark 15:21-32

根据马可 -- 马可福音15：21-32

According to Luke -- Luke 23:26-43

根据路加 -- 路加福音23：26-43

According to John -- John 19:17-27

根据约翰 -- 约翰福音19：17-27

The streets on which Jesus walked to the cross is called the Way of Sorrows (Via Dolorosa).  Leaving the court of Pilate, he was dressed in his own clothes, and a heavy cross was laid on his shoulders.  Condemned criminals usually had to carry their own crosses to the execution site.  The Lord did carry his cross (more accurately, our cross) as far as his tortured body would allow.  Then he collapsed.  The soldiers then made a pilgrim named Simon carry the cross the rest of the way.

耶稣走向十字架所路过的街道被称作“苦路”（Via Dolorosa）。离开彼拉多之后，耶稣穿着他自己的衣服，扛起了沉重的十字架。被定罪的犯人一般要扛着他自己的十字架走到行刑地。主扛着他的十字架（更准确地说，是我们的十字架），拖着他被拷打的身体尽力的向前走，直到他难以为继。士兵们于是勉强一位叫做西门的朝圣者，替耶稣扛十字架走余下的路。

The death march attracted a crowd.  Among them were some believing women who began to mourn and wail as was the local custom. However, Jesus would not even allow this expression of sorrow. He encouraged them to look into their own future and see the destruction of their city (A.D. 70). Jesus’ unselfish warning was his last public speech before his death.

死刑的队伍吸引了很多的人围观。在他们中间，有一群信主的妇女，开始按着当地的习俗哀号。然而，耶稣实际上不认同这样哀伤的表达。他鼓励她们着眼自己的未来，思想他们城市面临的毁灭（公元70年）。耶稣忘我的提醒是他受死前最后一次公开的布道。

At last they came to a skull-shaped hill outside the city wall.  There on Golgotha, or Calvary, Jesus was crucified between two criminals.  Nails were driven through his wrists and feet, and the cross was stood up. It was 9:00 A.M.

最后她们来到了城墙外面一座骷髅形状的山顶上。就是各各他，或者髑髅地，耶稣在这里被钉在十字架上，在两个罪犯的中间。钉子钉入他的手腕和脚掌，十字架被竖起。时间是当天的上午十点钟。

For the next three hours Jesus suffered the physical pain of crucifixion and mental suffering from the cruel Jewish and Roman spectators. But Jesus had expected such treatment and the Old Testament prophecies had already described the scene accurately (Psalm 22:1-18; Isaiah 53:12).

接下来的三个小时里，耶稣的身体忍受了十字架上极大的痛苦，残忍的犹太人和罗马的旁观者也在折磨着他的意志。但是，耶稣早就预料到这样的情形，旧约的先知们也早已精确地描述过这个场景（诗篇22:1-18；以赛亚书53:12）。

It was during these pre-noon hours that Jesus made his first three statements from the cross. In each case he showed true concern, not for himself, but for mankind. He prayed for who had caused his death, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” (Luke 23:34). To the repentant criminal on the cross next to him, he made the promise, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43).  Finally, Jesus gave instant comfort and lasting security to his dear mother bleeding from her very soul (Luke 2:35).  Referring to his beloved disciple John, Jesus said, "Dear woman, here is your son."  To John he explained, “Here is your mother” (John 19:26-27).

在中午之前的一两个小时内，耶稣在十字架上说了最初的三句话。每一句话都表明他所关心的不是他自己，而是所有的人。他为那些定他死罪的人祷告：“父啊，赦免他们！因为他们所做的，他们不晓得（路加福音23:34）”。对那个钉在他旁边悔改了的罪犯，耶稣给了他一个承诺：“我实在告诉你：今日你要同我在乐园里了（路加福音23:43）”。最后，耶稣深切地安慰了他的妈妈，为她的未来提供了持久的保证，抚平了她心灵深处的创痛。指着他所爱的门徒约翰，耶稣说：“母亲，看你的儿子。”然后又对约翰解释说：“看你的母亲”(约翰福音19:26-27)。

## The death of Jesus

    耶稣的死亡

According to Matthew -- Matthew 27:45-56

根据马太 -- 马太福音27：45-56

According to Mark -- Mark 15:33-41

根据马可 -- 马可福音15：33-41

According to Luke -- Luke 23:44-49

根据路加 -- 路加福音23：44-29

According to John -- John 19:28-37

根据约翰 -- 约翰福音19：28-37

At noon darkness fell across the whole earth, lasting for three hours.  This sign from heaven quieted the crowd.  No one could see Jesus' face during this time, and the Lord was left to himself.

随后在中午的时候，黑暗笼罩了全地，并持续了3个小时之久。这个天上的巨变使人群异常安静。期间没有人看得到耶稣的脸，他孤独的一个人。

We cannot imagine how much pain Jesus suffered during these dark hours.  The weight, guilt, and punishment for the sins of all mankind were on him.  Suddenly, at 3:00 P.M, Jesus cried out in a loud voice saying, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46; Psalm 22:1).  When God the Father withdraws himself from a person, then that person experiences hell (Matthew 25:41).

我们很难想象在日头变黑的几个小时里，耶稣忍受了多大的痛苦。世上每个人深重的罪孽，他们心里的愧疚和该受的惩罚，如今都在耶稣身上。突然，在下午三点钟，耶稣大声喊着说：“我的神！我的神！为什么离弃我？（马太福音27:46；诗篇22:1）”。当上帝使他自己与一个人隔绝时，那么这个人所经历的就是地狱（马太福音25:41）。

Light then returned to the earth.  The three hours of suffering in hell was completed. Jesus then found strength for three final statements.

随后，大地重现光明。三个小时地狱里的苦旅结束了。随后，耶稣打起精神说了最后的三句话。

He said, “I am thirsty” (John 19:28) so that the last Old Testament prophecy concerning his death might be fulfilled (Psalm 22:15; Psalm 69:21).

他说：“我渴了”（约翰福音19:28），由此旧约中最后一个关于他死亡的预言被验证（诗篇22:15；诗篇691:2）。

Once the drink had been given to him, Jesus could say confidently, “It is finished” (John 19:30). While his enemies were happy at his defeat, the shout of triumph comes from the lips of Jesus.  This word was a report to the Father who had sent him; but it was said in a loud voice so that all people could hear it. With the greatest single word ever spoken, he announced the finish of the work which his Father had given him.  Finished was his work of redemption, the work of bringing God and man together again, the work of suffering and dying for all people. The rule of the prince of hell had been broken, and Satan had been crushed under his heel.

当蘸满了醋的海绒被递给他后，耶稣可以安然地说出：“成了”（约翰福音19:30）。当他的敌人们正在为耶稣的失败而欣喜时，耶稣的嘴中大声说出了得胜的宣告。这个宣告是在对差遣他来的天父汇报；但是他用很大的声音说出来，使所有的人都听得到。随着这个伟大的词语被说出来，耶稣宣告天父所交给他的工作已经完成了。他完成了救赎之工，这工作使神与人和好，这受苦和受死的工作是为所有的人而做的。地狱之子的枷锁被打破了，撒旦被踏在耶稣的脚下。

With his mission finished, Jesus now could allow his broken body to die. His last words were, “Father, I give my spirit into your hands” (Luke 23:46).

随着耶稣使命的结束，耶稣如今可以允许他破碎的身体死去了。他最后的一句话是：“父啊，我将我的灵魂交在你手里。”（路加福音23:46）。

At that very moment God the Father added his own “amen” to Jesus’ perfect death. The Old Testament was closed; the new time of grace had begun. The curtain (as thick as the palm of a man's hand) which sealed off the Most Holy Place in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. This showed that because of Jesus’ atoning death all sinners can now approach God.  Meanwhile the earth shook.  The resurrection was begun as dead believers were made alive. A Roman centurion made a startling discovery:  Jesus was “a righteous man... The Son of God” (Luke 23:47; Mark 15:39).

就在那一刻，天父上帝用他自己的“阿们”回应了耶稣完美的死亡。旧的约终止了，恩典的时期已经开始。圣殿中遮蔽至圣所的幔子（）从上到下裂为两半。这表明因着耶稣的赎罪祭，所有的罪人现在可以亲近上帝了。这期间，地大震动。已死的信徒被赋予生命，复活开始了。一个罗马的百夫长惊讶地说出他的发现：“这（耶稣）真是个义人……这人真是神的儿子。”（路加福音23:47；马可福音15:39）。

## The Burial of Jesus

    耶稣的埋葬

According to Matthew -- Matthew 27:57-61

根据马太 -- 马太福音27：57-61

According to Mark -- Mark 15:42-47

根据马可 -- 马可福音15：42-47

According to Luke -- Luke 23:50-56

根据路加 -- 路加福音23：50-56

According to John -- John 19:38-42

根据约翰 -- 约翰福音19：38-42

Since evening was coming on and sundown marked the beginning of Saturday, the Sabbath, the Jews asked that the execution be completed and the bodies removed from the crosses. By breaking the two criminals’ legs the soldiers made sure that they would soon die. Jesus, however; was already dead.  A soldier stuck a spear into his side, missing his ribs, but piercing his heart. This too was according to God’s plan (Exodus 12:46; Psalm 34:20; Zechariah 12:10).

因为夜幕降临，太阳落山意味着安息日的开始，犹太人要求完成行刑并将尸体从十字架上移下。打折了耶稣身旁两个罪犯的腿骨之后，兵丁们知道他们会快会死去。然而，耶稣已经死了。一个兵丁用矛刺他的肋旁，没有刺到肋骨，而是直接刺入了心脏。这些同样都在上帝的计划中（出埃及记12:46；诗篇34:20；撒加利亚书12:10）。

The faithful women at the foot of the cross, as well as loyal John, were overcome with grief.  They had made no plans for the Lord’s burial.  But God the Father had worked out the details in advance (Isaiah 53:9).  The rich believer Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were allowed to bury the lifeless body.  Good Friday came to a close. The Lord was buried in the Garden Tomb and a large stone was rolled into place, closing the burial chamber.

忠心跟随的妇女们围在十字架下，沉浸在悲伤中，其中也包括忠诚的约翰。他们完全不知该如何安葬他们的主。但是天父上帝已经预先做好了一切（以赛亚书53:9）。一个富有的亚利马太城信徒约瑟，和尼哥德慕一起被允许埋葬了耶稣的尸体。受难日即将结束了。主被安葬在一座院子中的墓穴里，墓穴用一块滚来的大石头封住了入口。
